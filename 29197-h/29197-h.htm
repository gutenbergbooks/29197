<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>In presenting this book to the public the
author can only reiterate what she has already
said in works of a similar kind: that she has
tried to exclude the mass of confusing details
which often make the reading of history a
dreary task; and to keep closely to those facts
which are vital to the unfolding of the narrative.
This is done under a strong conviction
that the essential facts in history are those
which reveal and explain the development of
a nation, rather than the incidents, more or
less entertaining, which have attended such
development. And also under another conviction:
that a little, thoroughly comprehended,
is better than much imperfectly
remembered and understood.</p>

<h1>A SHORT HISTORY OF SPAIN.</h1>


<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>


<p>No name is more fraught with picturesque
and romantic interest than that of the "Spanish
Peninsula."</p>

<p>After finishing this rare bit of handiwork
nature seems to have thrown up a great
ragged wall, stretching from sea to sea, to protect
it; and the Pyrenees have stood for ages
a frowning barrier, descending toward France
on the northern side from gradually decreasing
heights&mdash;but on the Spanish side in wild
disorder, plunging down through steep
chasms, ravines, and precipices&mdash;with sharp
cliffs towering thousands of feet skyward,
which better than standing armies protect the
sunny plains below.</p>

<p>But the "Spanish Peninsula," at the time
we are about to consider, was neither "Spanish"
nor was it a "peninsula." At the dawn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id="page2"></a>[pg 2]</span>
of history this sunny corner of Europe was
known as <i>Iberia</i>, and its people as <i>Iberians</i>.</p>

<p>Time has effaced all positive knowledge of
this aboriginal race; but they are believed to
have come from the south, and to have been
allied to the Libyans, who inhabited the
northern coast of Africa. In fact, <i>Iberi</i> in
the Libyan tongue meant <i>freeman</i>; and
<i>Berber</i>, apparently derived from that word,
was the term by which all of these western
peoples were known to the Ancient Egyptians.</p>

<p>But it is suspected that the Iberians found
it an easy matter to flow into the land south
of the Pyrenees, and that they needed no
boats for the transit. There has always existed
a tradition of the joining of the two continents,
and now it is believed by geologists
that an isthmus once really stretched across
to the African coast at the narrowest point of
the Straits, at a time when the waters of a
Mediterranean gulf, and the waters flowing
over the sands of Sahara, together found their
outlet in the Indian Ocean.</p>

<p>There is also a tradition that the adventurous
Phenicians, who are known to have been
in Iberia as early as 1300 B.C., cut a canal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>[pg 3]</span>
through the narrow strip of land, and then
built a bridge across the canal. But a bridge
was a frail link by which to hold the mighty
continents together. The Atlantic, glad of
such an entrance to the great gulf beyond,
must have rushed impetuously through,
gradually widening the opening, and (may
have) thus permanently severed Europe and
Africa; drained the Sahara dry; transformed
the Mediterranean gulf into a Mediterranean
Sea; and created a "Spanish Peninsula."</p>

<p>How long this fair Peninsula was the undisturbed
home of the Iberians no one knows.
Behind the rocky ramparts of the Pyrenees
they may have remained for centuries unconscious
of the Aryan torrent which was flooding
Western Europe as far as the British Isles.
Nothing has been discovered by which we
may reconstruct this prehistoric people and
(perhaps) civilization. But their physical
characteristics we are enabled to guess; for
just as we find in Cornwall, England, lingering
traces of the ancient Britons, so in the
mountain fastnesses of northern Spain linger
the <i>Basques</i>, who are by many supposed to be
the last survivors of that mysterious primitive
race.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>[pg 4]</span>

<p>The language of the Basques bears no resemblance
to any of the Indo-European, nor
indeed to any known tongue. It is so difficult,
so intricate in construction, that only
those who learn it in infancy can ever master
it. It is said that, in Basque, "you spell Solomon,
and pronounce it Nebuchadnezzar."
Its antiquity is so great that one legend calls
it the "language of the angels," and another
says that <i>Tubal</i> brought it to Spain before the
lingual disaster at Babel! And still another
relates that the devil once tried to learn it,
but that, after studying it for seven years and
learning only three words, he gave it up in
despair.</p>

<p>A language which, without literature, can
so resist change, can so persist unmodified by
another tongue spoken all around and about
it, must have great antiquity; and there is
every reason to believe that the Basque is a
survival of the tongue spoken by the primitive
Iberians, before the Kelts began to flow
over and around the Pyrennees; and also that
the physical characteristics of this people are
the same as those of their ancient progenitors;
small-framed, dark, with a faint suggestion of
the Semitic in their swarthy faces.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>[pg 5]</span>

<p>We cannot say when it occurred, but at
last the powerful, warlike Kelts had surmounted
the barrier and were mingled with
this non-Aryan people, and the resulting race
thus formed was known to antiquity as the
<i>Keltiberians</i>.</p>

<p>It is probable that the rugged Kelt easily
absorbed the race of more delicate type, and
made it, in religion and customs, not unlike
the Keltic Aryan in Gaul. But the physical
characteristics of the other and primitive race
are indelibly stamped upon the Spanish people;
and it is probably to the Iberian strain in
the blood that may be traced the small, dark
type of men which largely prevails in Spain,
and to some extent also in central and southern France.</p>

<p>But the Keltiberians were Keltic in their
religion. There are now in Spain the usual
monuments found wherever Druid worship
prevailed. Huge blocks of stone, especially
in Cantabria and Lusitania (Portugal), standing
alone or in circles, tell the story of Druidical
rites, and of the worship of the ocean, the
wind, and the thunder, and of the placating of
the powers of nature by human sacrifices.</p>

<p>The mingling of the Kelts and the Iberians
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>[pg 6]</span>
in varying proportions in different parts of
Spain, and in some places (as among the
Basques) their mingling not at all, produced
that diversity of traits which distinguished the
<i>Asturians</i> in the mountain gorges from their
neighbors the <i>Cantabrians</i>, and both these
from the <i>Catalonians</i> in the northeast and the
<i>Gallicians</i> on the northwest coast, and from
the <i>Lusitanians</i>, where now is Portugal; and
still more distinguished the <i>Basques</i>, in the
rocky ravines of the Pyrenees, from each and
all of the others. And yet these unlike members
of one family were collectively known as
Keltiberians.</p>

<p>While this race&mdash;hardy, temperate, brave,
and superstitious&mdash;was leading its primitive
life upon the Iberian peninsula, while they
were shooting arrows at the sky to threaten
the thunder, drawing their swords against the
rising tide, and prizing iron more dearly than
their abundant gold and silver, because they
could hammer it into hooks, and swords, and
spears&mdash;there had long existed in the East a
group of wonderful civilizations: the Egyptian,
hoary with age and steeped in wisdom
and in wickedness; the <i>Chaldeans</i>, who, with
"looks commercing with the skies," were the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>[pg 7]</span>
fathers of astronomy; the <i>Assyrians</i> and
<i>Babylonians</i>, with their wonderful cities of
<i>Nineveh</i> and <i>Babylon</i>, and the Phenicians, with
their no less famous cities of <i>Sidon</i> and <i>Tyre</i>.
Sidon, which was the more ancient of these
two, is said to have been founded by Sidon,
the son of Canaan, who was the great-grandson
of Noah.</p>

<p>Of all these nations it was the Phenicians
who were the most adventurous. They were
a Semitic people, Syrian in blood, and their
home was a narrow strip of coast on the east
of the Mediterranean, where a group of free
cities was joined into a confederacy held together
by a strong national spirit.</p>

<p>Of these cities Sidon was once the head,
but in time Tyre eclipsed it in splendor, and
writers, sacred and profane, have sung her
glories.</p>

<p>These Phenicians had a genius for commerce
and trade. They scented a bargain
from afar, and knew how to exchange "their
broidered work, and fine linen, and coral, and
agate" (I Kings xxvii. 16), their glassware
and their wonderful cloths dyed in Tyrian
scarlet and purple, for the spices and jewels
of the East, and for the gold and silver
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>[pg 8]</span>
and the ivory and the ebony of the south
and west.</p>

<p>Their ships were coursing the Red Sea and
the Persian Gulf and bringing back treasures
from India and searching every inlet in the
Mediterranean, and finally, either through the
canal they are said to have cut, or the straits
it had made, they sailed as far as the British
Isles and brought back tin.</p>

<p>But the gold and silver of the Iberian
Peninsula were more alluring than the spices
of India or the tin of Britain. So upon the
Spanish coast they made permanent settlements
and built cities. As early as 1100 B.C.
they had founded beyond the "Pillars of
Hercules," the City of <i>Gades</i> (Cadiz), a walled
and fortified town, and had taught the Keltiberians
how to open and work their gold and
silver mines systematically; and in exchange
they brought an old civilization, with new
luxuries, new ideas and customs into the lives
of the simple people.</p>

<p>But they bestowed something far beyond
this&mdash;something more enriching than silver
and gold,&mdash;an alphabet,&mdash;and it is to the
Phenicians that we are indebted for the alphabet
now in use throughout the civilized world.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[pg 9]</span>




<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>


<p>Such an extension of power, and the acquisition
of sources of wealth so boundless, excited
the envy of other nations.</p>

<p>The Greeks are said to have been in the
Iberian peninsula long before the fall of Troy,
where they came with a fleet from Zante, in
the Ionian Sea, and in memory of that place,
called the city they founded Zacynthus, which
name in time became <i>Saguntum</i>. Now they
sent more expeditions and founded more
cities on the Spanish coast; and the Babylonians,
and the Assyrians, and, at a later time,
the Persians and the Greeks, all took up arms
against these insatiate traders.</p>

<p>Phenician supremacy was not easily maintained
with so many jealous rivals in the field,
and it was rudely shaken in 850 B.C., when</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"The Assyrian came down like the wolf on the fold,</p>
<p>And his cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>and the Phenician power was partially broken
at its source in the East.</p>

<p>It is with thrilling interest that we read
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg 10]</span>
Isaiah's prophecy of the destruction of Tyre,
which was written at this very time. For the
Phenicians were the <i>Canaanites</i> of Bible history,
and "Hiram King of Tyre" was their
king; and his "navy," which, together with
Solomon's "came once in three years from
<i>Tarshish</i>," was their navy; and <i>Tarshish</i> was
none other than <i>Tartessus</i>, their own province,
just beyond Gibraltar on the Spanish
coast. Nor is it at all improbable that Spanish
gold was used to adorn the temple which
the great Solomon was building. (I Kings
ix., x.) Shakspere, who says all things better
than anyone else, makes Othello find in the
fatal handkerchief "confirmation strong as
proofs from holy writ." Where can be found
"confirmation" stronger than these "proofs
from holy writ"? And where a more magnificent
picture of the luxury, the sumptuous
Oriental splendor of this nation at that period,
than in Ezekiel, chapters xxvii., xxviii.?
What an eloquent apostrophe to Tyre&mdash;"thou
that art situate at the entry of the sea,
a merchant of the people, for <i>many isles</i>."&mdash;"With
thy wisdom and with thine understanding
thou hast gotten thee riches," and,
"by thy great wisdom and by thy <i>traffick</i> hast
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[pg 11]</span>
thou increased, and thine heart is lifted up."
And then follows the terrible arraignment&mdash;"because
of the iniquity of thy <i>traffick</i>." And
then the final prediction of ruin&mdash;"I will
bring thee to ashes upon the earth"; "thou
shalt be a terror, and <i>never</i> shalt thou be any
more." Where in any literature can we find
such lurid splendor of description, and such
a powerful appeal to the imagination of the
reader! And where could the student of history
find a more graphic and accurate picture
of a vanished civilization!</p>

<p>In 850 B.C., the same year in which the
Assyrians partly subjugated the Phenicians in
the East, the city of Carthage was founded
upon the north coast of Africa, and there commenced
a movement, with that city as its center,
which drew together all their scattered
possessions into a Punic confederacy. This
was composed of the islands of Sardinia, Corsica,
part of Sicily, the Balearic Isles, and the
cities and colonies upon the Spanish Peninsula
and African coast. As the power of this confederacy
expands, the name Phenician passes
away and that of <i>Carthaginian</i> takes its place
in history.</p>

<p>Carthage became a mighty city, and controlled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg 12]</span>
with a strong hand the scattered
empire which had been planted by the
Syrian tradesmen. Carthaginian merchants
and miners were in Tartessus, and were planting
cities and colonies throughout the peninsula,
and a torrent of Carthaginian life was
thus pouring into Spain for many hundred
years, and the blood of the two races must
have freely mingled.</p>

<p>There are memorials of this time now existing,
not only in Phenician coins, medals,
and ruins, but in the names of the cities.
<i>Barcelona</i>, named after the powerful family of
Barca in Carthage, to which Hannibal belonged.
<i>Carthagena</i>, a memorial of Carthage,
which meant "the city"; and even <i>Cordova</i> is
traced to its primitive form,&mdash;Kartah-duba,&mdash;meaning
"an important city." While <i>Isabella</i>,
the name most famous in Spanish annals,
has a still greater antiquity; and was none
other than Jezebel&mdash;after the beautiful daughter
of the King of Sidon (the "<i>Zidoneans</i>"),
who married Ahab, and lured him to his
downfall. And we are told that this wicked
siren whose dreadful fate Elijah foretold,
was cousin to Dido, she who Virgil tells us
"wept in silence" for the faithless &#198;neas.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg 13]</span>
With what a strange thrill do we find these
threads of association between history sacred
and profane, and both mingled with the modern
history of Spain.</p>

<p>But Phenicia, for the "iniquity of her
traffick," was doomed. The roots of this old
Asiatic tree had been slowly and surely perishing,
while her branches in the West were
expanding. In the year 332 B.C. the siege and
destruction of Tyre, predicted five hundred
years before by Isaiah, was accomplished by
Alexander the Great, and the words of the
prophet found their complete fulfillment&mdash;that
the people of Tarshish should find no
city, no port, no welcome, when they came
back to Syria!</p>

<p>But on the northern coast of the Mediterranean
there was another power which was waxing,
while the Carthaginian was waning.
The occupation of the young Roman Republic
was not trade, but conquest. A bitter
enmity existed between the two nations.
Rome was determined to break this grasping
old Asiatic confederacy and to drive it out of
Europe. The Spanish Peninsula she knew
little about, but the rich islands near her own
coast&mdash;they must be hers.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg 14]</span>

<p>When, after the first Punic war (264-241
B.C.), the Carthaginians saw Sardinia and
Sicily torn from them, Hamilcar, their great
general, determined upon a plan of vengeance
which should make of Italy a Punic province.
His people were strong upon the sea, but for
this war of invasion they must have an army,
too. So he conceived the idea of making
Spain the basis of his military operations, and
recruiting an immense army from the Iberian
Peninsula.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg 15]</span>




<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>


<p>The Carthaginian occupation of Spain had
not extended much beyond the coast, and had
been rather in the nature of a commercial alliance
with a few cities. Now Hamilcar determined,
by placating, and by bribes, and if
necessary by force, to take possession of the
Peninsula for his own purposes, and to make
of the people a Punic nation under the complete
dominion of Carthage. So his first task
was to win, or to subdue, the Keltiberians.
He built the city of New Carthage (now
Carthagena), he showed the people how to develop
their immense resources, and by promises
of increased prosperity won the confidence
and sympathy of the nation, and soon
had a population of millions from which to
recruit its army.</p>

<p>When his son Hannibal was nine years old,
at his father's bidding he placed his hand upon
the altar and swore eternal enmity to Rome.
The fidelity of the boy to his oath made a
great deal of history. He took up the task
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg 16]</span>
when his father laid it down, inaugurated the
second Punic war (218-201 B.C.); and for
forty years carried on one of the most desperate
struggles the world has ever seen; the
hoary East in struggle with the young West.</p>

<p>Saguntum was that ancient city in Valencia
which was said to have been founded by the
Greeks long before Homer sang of Troy,
or, indeed, before Helen brought ruin upon
that city. At all events its antiquity was
greater even than that of the Phenician cities
in Spain, and after being long forgotten by
the Greeks it had drifted under Roman protection.
It was the only spot in Spain which
acknowledged allegiance to Rome; and for
that reason was marked for destruction as an
act of defiance.</p>

<p>The Saguntines sent an embassy to Rome.
These men made a pitiful and passionate appeal
in the Senate Chamber: "Romans, allies,
friends! help! help! Hannibal is at the gates
of our city. Hannibal, the sworn enemy of
Rome. Hannibal the terrible. Hannibal
who fears not the gods, neither keeps faith
with men. ["Punic faith" was a byword.]
O Romans, fathers, friends! help while there
is yet time."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg 17]</span>

<p>But they found they had a "protector"
who did not protect. The senators sent an
embassy to treat with Hannibal, but no soldiers.
So, with desperate courage, the Saguntines
defended their beleaguered city for
weeks, hurling javelins, thrusting their lances,
and beating down the besiegers from the
walls. They had no repeating rifles nor dynamite
guns, but they had the terrible <i>falaric</i>,
a shaft of fir with an iron head a yard long, at
the point of which was a mass of burning tow,
which had been dipped in pitch. When a
breach was made in the walls, the inflowing
army would be met by a rain of this deadly
falaric, which was hurled with telling power
and precision. Then, in the short interval of
rest this gave them, men, women, and children
swiftly repaired the broken walls before
the next assault.</p>

<p>But at last the resourceful Hannibal abandoned
his battering rams, and with pickaxes
undermined the wall, which fell with a crash.
When asked to surrender, the chief men of the
city kindled a great fire in the market-place,
into which they then threw all the silver and
gold in the treasury, their own gold and silver
and garments and furniture, and then cast
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg 18]</span>
themselves headlong into the flames. This
was their answer.</p>

<p>Saguntum, which for more than a thousand
years had looked from its elevation out upon
the sea, was no more, and its destruction was
one of the thrilling tragedies of ancient history.
On its site there exists to-day a town
called <i>Mur Viedro</i> (old walls), and these old
walls are the last vestige of ancient Saguntum.</p>

<p>In order to understand the indifference of
Rome to the Spanish Peninsula at this time, it
must be remembered that Spain was then the
uttermost verge of the known world, beyond
which was only a dread waste of waters and of
mystery. To the people of Tyre and of
Greece, the twin "Pillars of Hercules" had
marked the limit beyond which there was
nothing; and those two columns, Gibraltar
and Ceuta, with the legend <i>ne plus ultra</i> entwined
about them, still survive, as a symbol,
in the arms of Spain and upon the Spanish
coins; and what is still more interesting to
Americans, in the familiar mark ($) which represents
a dollar. (The English name for the
Spanish <i>peso</i> is <i>pillar-dollar</i>.)</p>

<p>Now Rome was aroused from its apathy.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg 19]</span>
It sent an army into Spain, led by Scipio the
Elder, known as Scipio Africanus. When
he fell, his son, only twenty-four years old,
stood up in the Roman Forum and offered to
fill the undesired post; and, in 210 B.C., Scipio
"the Younger"&mdash;and the greater&mdash;took the
command&mdash;as Livy eloquently says&mdash;"between
the tombs of his father and his uncle",
who had both perished in Spain within a
month.</p>

<p>The chief feature of Scipio's policy was,
while he was defeating Hannibal in battles, to
be undermining him with his native allies;
and to make that people realize to what hard
taskmasters they had bound themselves; and
by his own manliness and courtesy and justice
to win them to his side.</p>

<p>He marched his army swiftly and unexpectedly
upon New Carthage, the capital and center
of the whole Carthaginian movement, sent
his fleet to blockade the city, and planned
his moves with such precision that the
fleet for the blockade and the army for the
siege arrived before the city on the same
day.</p>

<p>Taken entirely by surprise. New Carthage
was captured without a siege. Not one of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg 20]</span>
inhabitants was spared, and spoil of fabulous
amounts fell to the victors.</p>

<p>It seems like a fairy tale&mdash;or like the story
of Mexico and Peru 1800 years later&mdash;to read
of 276 golden bowls which were brought
to Scipio's tent, countless vessels of silver,
and 18 tons of coined and wrought
silver.</p>

<p>But the richest part of the prize was the 750
Spanish hostages&mdash;high in rank of course&mdash;whom
the various tribes had given in pledge
of their fidelity to Carthage. Now Scipio held
these pledges, and they were a menace and a
promise. They were Roman slaves, but he
could by kindness, and by holding out the
hope of emancipation, placate and further
bind to him the native people.</p>

<p>By an exercise of tact and clemency Scipio
gained such an ascendancy over the inhabitants,
and so moved were they by this unexpected
generosity and kindness, that many
would gladly have made him their king.</p>

<p>But he seems to have been the "noblest
Roman of them all," and when saluted as king
on one occasion he said: "Never call me king.
Other nations may revere that name, but
no Roman can endure it. My soldiers have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg 21]</span>
given me a more honorable title&mdash;that of
general."</p>

<p>Such nobility, such a display of Roman
virtue, was a revelation to these barbarians;
and they felt the grandeur of the words,
though they could not quite understand them.
They were won to the cause of Rome, and
formed loyal alliances with Scipio which they
never broke.</p>

<p>In the year 206 B.C. Gades (Cadiz), the last
stronghold, was surrendered to the Romans,
and the entire Spanish Peninsula had been
wrenched from the Carthaginians.</p>

<p><i>Iberia</i> was changed to <i>Hispania</i>, and fifteen
years later the whole of the Peninsula was organized
into a Roman province, thenceforth
known in history, not as <i>Iberia</i>, nor yet <i>Hispania</i>;
but <i>Spain</i>, and its people as <i>Spaniards</i>.</p>

<p>At the end of the third Punic war (149-146
B.C.), the ruin of the Carthaginians was complete.
Hannibal had died a fugitive and a
suicide. His nation had not a single ship upon
the seas, nor a foot of territory upon the earth,
and the great city of Carthage was plowed
and sowed with salt. Rome had been used by
Fate to fulfill her stern decree&mdash;"<i>Delenda est
Carthago</i>."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg 22]</span>

<p>It was really only a limited portion of the
Peninsula; a fringe of provinces upon the
south and east coast, which had been under
Carthaginian and now acknowledged Roman
dominion. Beyond these the Keltiberian
tribes in the center formed a sort of confederation,
and consented to certain alliances with
the Romans; while beyond them, intrenched
in their own impregnable mountain fastnesses,
were brave, warlike, independent tribes, which
had never known anything but freedom,
whose names even, Rome had not yet heard.
The stern virtue and nobility of Scipio proved
a delusive promise. Rome had not an easy
task, and other and brutal methods were to be
employed in subduing stubborn tribes and
making of the whole a Latin nation. In one
of the defiles of the Pyrenees there may now be
seen the ruins of fortifications built by Cato
the Elder, not long after Scipio, which show
how early those free people in the north were
made to feel the iron heel of the master and to
learn their lesson of submission.</p>

<p>The century which followed Scipio's conquest
was one of dire experience for Spain.
A Roman army was trampling out every vestige
of freedom in provinces which had known
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg 23]</span>
nothing else; and more than that, Roman
diplomacy was making of their new possession
a fighting ground for the civil war which
was then raging at Rome; and partisans of
Marius and of Sylla were using and slaughtering
the native tribes in their own desperate
struggle. Roman rule was arrogant and
oppressive, Roman governors cruel, arbitrary,
and rapacious, and the boasted "Roman virtue"
seemed to have been left in Rome, when
treaties were made only to be violated at
pleasure.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg 24]</span>




<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>


<p>As nature delights in adorning the crevices
of crumbling ruins with mosses and graceful
lichens, so literature has busied itself with
these historic ruins; and Cervantes has made
the siege of Numantia (134 B.C.)&mdash;more terrible
even than that of Saguntum&mdash;the subject
of a poem, in which he depicts the horrors
of the famine.</p>

<p>Lira, the heroine, answers her ardent lover
Mirando in high-flown Spanish phrase, which,
when summed up in plain English prose,
means that she cannot listen to his wooing,
because she is so hungry&mdash;which, in view of
the fact that she has not tasted food for weeks,
seems to us not surprising!</p>

<p>Sertorius, whose story is told by Plutarch,
affords another picturesque subject for Corneille
in one of his most famous tragedies.
This Roman was an adherent of Marius in the
long struggle with Sylla, and while upholding
his cause in Spain he won to his side the people
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg 25]</span>
of Lusitania (Portugal), who made him
their ruler, and helped him to fight the great
army of the opposing Roman faction, part of
which was led by Pompey.</p>

<p>Mithridates, in Asia Minor, was also in conflict
with Sylla, and sent an embassy to Sertorius
which led to a league between the two
for mutual aid, and for the defense of the cause
of Marius. But senators of his own party became
jealous of the great elevation of Sertorius,
and conspired to assassinate him at a
feast to which he was invited. So ended (72 B.C.)
one of the most picturesque characters
and interesting episodes in the difficult march
of barbarous Spain toward enlightenment and
civilization.</p>

<p>Sertorius seems to have been a great administrator
as well as fighter, and must also be
counted one of the civilizers of Spain. He
founded a school at Osca,&mdash;now Huesca,&mdash;where
he had Roman and Greek masters for
the Spanish youth. And it is interesting to
learn that there is to-day at that city a university
which bears the title "University of
Sertorius."</p>

<p>But it is not the valor nor the sagacity of
Sertorius which made him the favorite of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[pg 26]</span>
poets; but the story of the White Hind, which
he made to serve him so ingeniously in establishing
his authority with the Lusitanians.</p>

<p>A milk-white fawn, on account of its rarity,
was given him by a peasant. He tamed her,
and she became his constant companion, unaffrighted
even in the tumult of battle. He
saw that the people began to invest the little
animal with supernatural qualities; so, finally,
he confided to them that she was sent to him
by the Goddess Diana, who spoke to him
through her, and revealed important secrets.</p>

<p>Such is the story which Corneille and
writers in other lands have found so fascinating,
and which an English author has made
the subject of his poem "The White Hind of
Sertorius."</p>

<p>Another Roman civil war, more pregnant
of great results, was to be fought out in Spain.
Julius C&#230;sar's conspiracy against the Roman
Republic, and his desperate fight with Pompey
for the dictatorship, long drenched Spanish
soil with blood, and had its final culmination
(after Pompey's tragic death in Egypt)
in C&#230;sar's victory over Pompey's sons at
Munda, in Spain, 45 B.C.</p>

<p>With this event, the military triumphs and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg 27]</span>
the intrigues of C&#230;sar had accomplished his
purpose. He was declared <i>Imperator</i>, perpetual
Dictator of Rome, and religious sacrifices
were decreed to him as if he were a god.
Unconscious of the chasm which was yawning
at his feet he haughtily accepted the honors
and adulation of men who were at that very
moment conspiring for his death. On the
fatal "Ides of March" (44 B.C.) he was
stricken in the Senate Chamber by the hands
of his friends, and the great C&#230;sar lay dead at
the feet of Pompey's statue.</p>

<p>The world had reached a supreme crisis in
its existence. Two events&mdash;the most momentous
it has ever known&mdash;were at hand:
the birth of a Roman Empire, which was to
perish in a few centuries, after a life of amazing
splendor; and the birth of a spiritual kingdom,
which would never die!</p>

<p>C&#230;sar's nephew, Octavius Augustus, by
gradual approaches reached the goal toward
which no doubt his greater uncle was moving.
After defeating Brutus and Cassius at Philippi
(42 B.C.) and then after destroying his only
competitor, Antony, at Actium (31 B.C.) he
assumed the imperial purple under the name
of Augustus. The title sounded harmless,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[pg 28]</span>
but its wearer had founded the "Roman Empire."</p>

<p>At last there was peace. Spain was pacified,
and only here and there did she struggle in the
grasp of the Romans. Augustus, to make
sure of the permanence of this pacification,
himself went to the Peninsula. He built
cities in the plains, where he compelled the
stubborn mountaineers to reside, and established
military colonies in the places they had
occupied.</p>

<p>Saragossa was one of these cities in the
plains, and its name was "C&#230;sar Augusta,"
and many others have wandered quite as far
from their original names, which may, however,
still be traced.</p>

<p>It is said that "the annals of the happy are
brief." Let us hope that poor Spain, so long
harried by fate, was happy in the next four
hundred years, for her story can be briefly
told. She seemed to have settled into a state
of eternal peace. It was a period not of
external events, but of a process&mdash;an internal
process of assimilation. Spain, in every department
of its life, was becoming Latinized.</p>

<p>A people of rare intellectual activity had
been united to the life of Rome at the moment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg 29]</span>
of her greatest intellectual elevation.
Was it strange that no Roman province ever
produced so long a list of historians, poets,
philosophers, as did Southern Spain after the
Augustan conquest? When we read the list
of great Roman authors who were born in
Spain&mdash;the three Senecas, one of whom, the
author and wit, opened his veins at the command
of Nero (65 A.D.), and another, the
Gallio of the book of Acts; also Lucan, Martial,
and Quintilian, when we read these
names native to Spain, it seems as if the
source of inspiration had removed from the
banks of the Tiber to the banks of the
Guadalquivir.</p>

<p>Nowhere can the student of Roman antiquities
find a richer field than in Spain. And
not only that, there is to-day in the manners
and customs, and in the habits of the peasantry,
a pervading atmosphere of the classic land
which adopted them, which all that has occurred
since has been powerless to efface,
while the language of Spain is Latin to its
core. Nor is this strange when we reflect
that they were under this powerful influence
for a period as long as from Christopher
Columbus to the Spanish-American War!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>


<p>In the history of nations there is one fact
which again and again with startling uniformity
repeats itself. The rough, strong races
from the north menace, and at last rudely
dominate more highly civilized but less hardy
races at the South, to the ultimate benefit of
both, although with much present discomfort
to the conquered race!</p>

<p>In Greece it was first the rude Hellenes who
overran the Pelasgians. And again, long
after that, there was another descent of fierce
northern barbarians,&mdash;the Dorians from
Epirus,&mdash;who, when they took possession
of the Peloponnesus and became the <i>Spartans</i>,
infused that vigorous strain without
which the history of Greece might have been
a very tame affair. In the British Isles it was
the Picts and Scots, who would have done
the same thing with England, perhaps, if the
Angles and Saxons had not come to the rescue,
while Spain had her own Picts and Scots
in the mountain tribes of the Pyrenees. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[pg 31]</span>
in the fifth century there was the most stupendous
illustration of this tendency, when all
of Southern Europe was at last inundated by
that northern deluge, and the effete Roman
Empire was effaced.</p>

<p>The process had been a gradual one; had
commenced, in fact, two centuries before the
overthrow of the Roman Republic. But not
until the fourth century, after the wicked old
empire had espoused Christianity, did it become
obvious that its foundations were undermined
by this flood of barbarians. In 410
A.D., when the West-Goths, under Alaric,
entered and sacked Rome, her power was
broken. The roots no longer nourished the
distant extremities in Britain and Gaul, and it
was only a question of time when these, too,
should succumb to the inflowing tide.</p>

<p>The Ostro-Goths&mdash;or East-Goths&mdash;in
Northern Italy, and the Visigoths&mdash;or West-Goths&mdash;in
Gaul, were setting up kingdoms of
their own, under a Roman protectorate. The
long period of peace in Spain was broken.
The Pyrenees, with their warlike tribes, defended
her for a time; but the Suevi and the
Vandals&mdash;the latter a companion tribe of the
Goths&mdash;had found an easier entrance by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg 32]</span>
sea on the east. They flowed down toward the
south, and from thence across to the northern
coast of Africa, which they colonized,
leaving a memorial in Spain, in the lovely
province of Andalusia, which was named after
them&mdash;<i>Vandalusia</i>. But before the sacking
of Rome a wave of the Gothic invasion had
overflowed the Pyrenees, and Northern Spain
had become a part of the Gothic kingdom in
Gaul, with the city of Toulouse as its head.</p>

<p>A century of contact with Roman civilization
had wrought great changes in this
conquering race. They were untamed in
strength, but realized the value of the civilities
of life, and of intellectual superiority; and
even strove to acquire some of the arts and
accomplishments of the race they were invading.
They were not yet acknowledged
entire masters of Gaul and northern Spain.
On condition of military service they had undisputed
possession of their territory, with
their own king, laws, and customs, but were
nominally subjects of the Roman Emperor,
Honorius.</p>

<p>Their attitude toward the Romans at this
period cannot better be told than in the words
of Ataulf himself (or Ataulfus, or Adolphus),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[pg 33]</span>
whose interesting story will be briefly related.
He says:</p>

<p>"It was my first wish to destroy the Roman
name and erect in its place a Gothic Empire,
taking to myself the place and the powers of
C&#230;sar Augustus. But when experience
taught me that the untamable barbarism of
the Goths would not suffer them to live under
the sway of law, and that the abolition of the
institutions on which the state rested would
involve the ruin of the state itself, I chose instead
the glory of renewing and maintaining
by Gothic strength the fame of Rome; preferring
to go down to posterity as the restorer
of that Roman power which it was beyond my
power to replace."</p>

<p>These are not the words of a barbarian;
although by the corrupt and courtly nobles in
Rome he was considered one; but no doubt
he towered far above the barbarous host
whom he helped to lead into Rome in the
year 410 A.D.</p>

<p>Ataulf was the brother-in-law of Alaric, and
succeeded that great leader in authority after
his death (410 A.D.).</p>

<p>At the time of the sacking of Rome this
Gothic prince fell in love with Placidia, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[pg 34]</span>
sister of the Emperor Honorius; and after the
fashion of his people, carried her away as his
captive; not an unwilling one, we suspect, for
we learn of her great devotion to her brave,
strong wooer, with blond hair and blue eyes.
Ataulf took his fair prize to the city of Narbonne
in southern France, and made her his
Queen. But when Constantius, a disappointed
Roman lover of Placidia's, instigated
Honorius to send an army against him and
his Goths, he withdrew into Spain, and established
his court with its rude splendor in the
ancient city of Barcelona.</p>

<p>He seems to have had not an easy task between
the desire to please his haughty Roman
bride and, at the same time, to repel the
charge of his people that he was becoming
effeminate and Romanized; and, finally, so
jealous did they become of her influence that
Ataulf was assassinated in the presence of his
wife, all his children butchered, and the
proud Placidia compelled to walk barefoot
through the streets of Barcelona.</p>

<p>Constantius, the faithful Roman lover,
came with an army and carried back to Rome
the royal widow, who married him and became
the mother of Valentinian III., who succeeded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[pg 35]</span>
his uncle Honorius as Emperor of Rome in
425 A.D., under the regency of Placidia during
his infancy.</p>

<p>This romance, lying at the very root of a
Gothic dynasty in Spain, marks the earliest
beginnings of a line of Visigoth kings.
Ataulf's successor removed his court to Toulouse
in France, and Spain for many years
remained only an outlying province of the
Gothic kingdom; her turbulent northern
tribes refusing to accept or to mingle with
the strange intruders. When driven by the
Romans from their mountain fastnesses
the Basques, many of them, were at that
time dispersed through southern and central
France; which accounts for the presence
of that race in France, before alluded to.</p>

<p>In the second half of the fifth century Attila,
"the Scourge of God," swept down upon
Europe with his Huns,&mdash;mysterious, terrible,
as a fire out of heaven, and more like an army
of demons than men,&mdash;destroying city after
city, and driving the people before them, until
they came to Orl&#233;ans. There they met the
combined Roman and Gothic armies. Theodoric,
the Visigoth king, was killed on the
battlefield. But to him, and to the Roman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[pg 36]</span>
general &#198;tius, belongs the glory of the defeat
of the Huns (451 A.D.).</p>

<p>It was Evaric, the son of this Theodoric,
who finally completed the conquest of the
Spanish Peninsula, and with him really commences
the line of Visigoth kings in Spain,
and the conversion of that country into a
Gothic empire,<a id="footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a><a href=
  "#footnote1"><sup>A</sup></a> entirely independent of
Rome.</p>

<p>The German <i>Franks</i>, under Clovis, established
their kingdom in Gaul 481 A.D.
The <i>Angles</i> and <i>Saxons</i> in 446 A.D. did
the same in Britain. The <i>Ostrogoths</i> had
their own kingdom in northern Italy and
southern Gaul (Burgundy). So, with the
<i>Visigoths</i> ruling in Spain, the "northern deluge"
had in the fifth century practically submerged
the whole of Europe, and above its
dark waters showed only the somber wreck of
a Roman empire.</p>

<p>From this fusing of Roman and Teutonic
races there were to arise two types of civilization,
utterly different in kind, the <i>Anglo-Saxon</i>
and the <i>Latin</i>. In one the prevailing
element, after the fusing was complete, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg 37]</span>
to be the Teutonic; in the other, the Roman.
Herein lies the difference between these two
great divisions of the human family, and this
is the germinal fact in the war raging to-day
between Spain and the United States. It is
a difference created not by the mastery of
arms, but by the more efficient mastery of
ideas.</p>

<p>When the Angles and Saxons conquered
Britain, after a Roman occupation of over
three hundred years, they swept it clean of
Roman laws, literature, and civilization.
Untamed pagan barbarians though they
were, they had fine instincts and simple ideals
of society and government, and they cast out
the corrupt old empire, root and branch.</p>

<p>The Visigoths in Spain, more enlightened
than they, already Christianized, and, perhaps,
even superior in intelligence, were content in
the words of Ataulf&mdash;"to renew and maintain
by Gothic strength the fame of Rome." So
they built upon the ruins of decaying institutions
of a corrupt civilization, a kingdom
which flourished with the enormous vitality
drawn from the conquering race, which race
was in turn conquered by Roman ideals.</p>

<p>So, in the conflict now existing between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg 38]</span>
Spain and the United States, we see the Spaniard,
the child of the Romans; valorous, picturesque,
cruel, versed in strategic arts, and
with a savor of archaic wickedness which belongs
to a corrupt old age. In the American
we see the child of the simple Angles and Saxons,
no less brave, but just, and with an
enthusiasm and confiding integrity which
seems to endow him with an imperishable
youth.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote1" name="footnote1"></a><b>Footnote A:</b><a href="#footnotetag1"> (return) </a><p>The famous Gothic code established by him still linger

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[pg 39]</span>




<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>


<p>The story of Ulfilas, who Christianized the
pagan Goths in the last half of the fourth century,
is really the first chapter not alone in the
history of Gothic civilization but in that of
the German and English literatures; which,
with their vast riches, had their origin in the
strange achievement of Ulfilas. He had,
while a boy, been captured by some Goths off
the coast of Asia Minor, and was called by
them "<i>Wulf-ilas</i>" (little wolf). In his desire
to translate the Bible to his captors
Wulf-ilas reduced the Gothic language to
writing. He had first to create an alphabet;
taking twenty-two Roman letters, and
inventing two more: the letter <i>w</i>, and still
another for <i>th</i>. So while, after Constantine,
the Christian religion was being adopted by
the Roman Empire, and while its simple dogmas
were being discussed and refined into a
complicated and intricate system by men
versed in Greek philosophy, and then formulated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg 40]</span>
by minds trained in logic and rhetoric,
the same religion was being spelled out in
simple fashion by the Goths in central Europe
from the book translated for them by Ulfilas.</p>

<p>All they found was that Jesus Christ was
the beloved son of God and the Saviour of the
world; that he was the long-promised
Messiah, and to believe in him and to follow
his teachings was salvation. They knew
nothing of the Trinity nor of any theologic
subtleties, and this was the simple faith which
the Goths carried with them into the lands
they conquered.</p>

<p>The Romans, who had spent three centuries
in burning Christians and trying to obliterate
the religion of Christ, were now its jealous
guardians. They considered this "Arianism,"
as it was called, a blasphemous heresy,
so shocking that they refused to call it Christianity
at all. The history of the first century
of the Gothic kingdom in Spain was therefore
mainly that of the deadly strife between Arianism
and Catholicism, or orthodoxy. The
Goths could not discuss, for they were utterly
unable to understand even the terms under
discussion; but they could fight and lay down
their lives for the faith which had done so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg 41]</span>
much for them; and this they did freely and
fiercely.</p>

<p>So the simple Gothic people were bewildered
by finding themselves in the presence of
a Christianity incomprehensible to them; a
complicated, highly organized social order,
equally incomprehensible; and a science and a
literature of which they knew nothing. They
might struggle for a while against this tide of
superiority, but one by one they entered the
fascinating portals of learning and of art, accepted
the dogmas of learned prelates, and a
few generations were sufficient to make them
meek disciples of the older civilization.</p>

<p>The Spanish language fairly illustrates the
result from this incongruous mingling of
Roman and Gothic. It is said to be a language
of Latin roots with a Teutonic grammar.</p>

<p>The Goths laid rough hands on the speech
they consented to use, and the smooth,
sonorous Latin was strangely broken and
mixed with Gothic words and idioms; yet it
became one of the most copious, flexible, and
picturesque of languages, with a literature
marvelously rich and beautiful.</p>

<p>In precisely the same way was the classic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg 42]</span>
old ruin of a Roman state re-enforced with a
rough Gothic framework, and after centuries
have hidden the joints and the scars with
mosses and verdure, we have a picturesque
and beautiful Spain!</p>

<p>But barbarous kings were fighting other
things besides heresy. There were rebellions
to put down; there were remnants of Sueves
and of Roman power to drive out, and there
were always the fierce mountain tribes who
never mingled with any conquerors, nor had
ever surrendered to anything but the Catholic
faith.</p>

<p>There were intermarriages between the
three Gothic kingdoms, in Burgundy, Gaul,
and Spain, and the history of some of these
royal families shows what wild passions still
raged among the Goths, and what atrocities
were strangely mingled with ambitious projects
and religion.</p>

<p>Athanagild, one of the Visigoth kings, gave
his daughter Brunhilde in marriage to the
King of the Franks in Gaul. The story of
this terrible Queen, stained with every crime,
and accused of the death of no less than ten
kings, comes to a fitting end when, we are
told, that in her wicked old age she was tied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>[pg 43]</span>
to the tail of an unbroken horse and dragged
over the stones of Paris (600 A.D.).</p>

<p>At this time Leovigild (570-587), the Visigoth
King, was ruling Spain with a strong
hand. He had assumed more splendor than
any of his predecessors. He had erected a
magnificent throne in his palace at Toledo,
and his head, wearing the royal diadem, was
placed on Spanish coins, which may still be
seen. A daughter of the terrible Brunhilde,
the Princess Ingunda, came over from France
to become the wife of Ermingild, the son of
the great King Leovigild, and heir to his
throne.</p>

<p>All went smoothly until it was discovered
that this fair Princess was a Catholic, and was
artfully plotting to win her husband over to
her faith from the faith of his fathers&mdash;Arianism.</p>

<p>Although Catholicism had made great inroads
among their people, never before had it
invaded the royal household. And when his
son declared his intention to desert their ancient
creed there commenced a terrible conflict
between father and son, which finally led to
Ermingild's open rebellion, and at last to his
being beheaded by his father's order. But this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[pg 44]</span>
crime against nature was in vain. Arianism
had reached the limit of its life in Spain.
Upon the death of Leovigild, his second son,
Recared (587-601), succeeded to the throne,
and one of his first acts was to abjure the old
faith of the Gothic people, and Catholicism became
the established religion of Spain.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>[pg 45]</span>




<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>


<p>Toledo, the capital of the Visigoth Kings, is
the city about which cluster the richest memories
of Spain in her heroic age. When Leovigild
removed his capital there from Seville
in the sixth century, it was already an ancient
Jewish city, about which tradition had long
busied itself. To-day, as it sits on the summit
of a barren hill, one looks in vain for traces
of its ancient Gothic splendor. But the spot
where now stands a beautiful cathedral is hallowed
by a wonderful legend, which Murillo
made the subject of one of his great paintings.
It is said that the Apostle St. James founded
on that very spot the Church of <i>Santa Maria</i>;
and that the Virgin, in recognition of the
dedication to her, descended from heaven to
present its Bishop, Ildofonso, with a marvelous
chasuble. In proof of this miracle,
doubting visitors are still shown the marks of
Mary's footprint upon a stair in the chapel!
However this may be, it is on this very spot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[pg 46]</span>
that King Recared formally abjured Arianism;
and preserved in a cloister of the cathedral
may still be seen the "Consecration Stone"
which reads: that the Church of Santa Maria,&mdash;built
probably on the foundation of the
older church,&mdash;was consecrated under "King
Recared the Catholic, 587 A.D." It also tells
of the councils of the Spanish Church held
there&mdash;at one of which councils was the
famous canon which decreed that all future
Kings must swear they would show no mercy
to "that accursed people"&mdash;meaning the
Jews. It was these very Jews who had
brought commercial success and created the
enormous wealth of the city, from which it
was now the duty of the pious Visigoth Kings
to harry and hunt them as if they were frightened
deer.</p>

<p>The Visigoth monarchy, although in many
cases hereditary, was in fact elective. And
the student of Spanish history will not find an
orderly royal succession as in England and
France. Disputes regarding the succession
were not infrequent, and sometimes there will
occur an interval with apparently no king at
all, followed by another period when there are
two&mdash;one ruling in the north and another in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[pg 47]</span>
the south. "The King is dead&mdash;long live the
King!" might do for France, but not for
Spain.</p>

<p>During one of these periods of uncertainty,
in the latter half of the seventh century, it is
said that Leo, a holy man (afterward Pope),
was told in a dream that the man who must
wear the crown was then a laborer, living in
the west, and that his name was Wamba.
They traveled in search of this man almost
to the borders of Portugal, and there they
found the future candidate for the throne
plowing in the field. The messengers, bowing
before the plowman, informed him that
he had been selected as King of Spain.</p>

<p>Wamba laughed, and said, "Yes, I shall be
King of Spain when my pole puts forth
leaves."</p>

<p>Instantly the bare pole began to bud, and
in a few moments was covered with verdure!</p>

<p>In vain did Wamba protest. What could a
poor man do in the face of such a miracle,
and with a Spanish Duke pressing a poniard
against his breast, and telling him to choose
on the instant between a throne and a tomb!</p>

<p>The unhappy Wamba suffered himself to
be borne in triumph to Toledo, and there to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg 48]</span>
be crowned. And a very wise and excellent
King did he make. He seemed fully equal
to the difficult demands of his new position.
A rebellion, fomented by an ambitious Duke
Paul, who gathered about his standard all the
banished Jews, was a very formidable affair.
But Wamba put it down with a firm hand, and
then, when it was over, treated the conspirators
and rebels with marvelous clemency.
When his reign was concluded he left a record
of wisdom and sagacity rare in those days, in
any land.</p>

<p>His taking off the stage was as remarkable
as his coming on. He fell into a trance
(October 14, 680), and after long insensibility
it was concluded that the King was dying.
According to a custom of the period Wamba's
head was shaved, and he was clothed in the
habit of a monk. The meaning of this was
that if he died, he would, as was fitting, pass
into the Divine presence in penitential garb.
But if, peradventure, the patient survived, he
was pledged to spend the rest of his life in
that holy vocation, renouncing every worldly
advantage.</p>

<p>So when, after a few hours, Wamba, in perfect
health, opened his eyes, he found that instead
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[pg 49]</span>
of a King he was transformed into a
Monk!</p>

<p>Whether this was a cunning device of this
philosophic King to lay down the burdens
which wearied him, and spend the rest of his
days in tranquility; or whether it was the work
of the Royal Prince, who joyfully assumed the
diadem which he had so unwillingly worn,
nobody knows. But Wamba passed the remainder
of his days in a monastery near
Burgos, and the ambitious Ervigius reigned
as his successor.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[pg 50]</span>




<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>


<p>The Visigoth kingdom, which had stood
for three centuries, had passed its meridian.
It had created a magnificent background for
historic Spain, and a heritage which would be
the pride and glory of the proudest nation in
Europe. The Goths had come as only rude
intruders into that country; but to be
descended from the Visigoth Kings was hereafter
to be the proudest boast of the Spaniard.
And the man who could make good such
claim to distinction was a <i>Hidalgo</i>; or in its
original form, <i>hijo-de-algo</i>&mdash;son of somebody.</p>

<p>But many generations of peace had impaired
the rugged strength and softened the
sinews of the nation. It was the beginning of
the end when, at the close of the seventh century,
there were two rival claimants to the
throne; and while the vicious and cruel
Witiza reigned at Toledo, Roderick, the son
of Theodofred, also reigned in Andalusia.
There had been a long struggle, during which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[pg 51]</span>
it is said that Theodofred's eyes had been put
out by his victorious rival, and his son Roderick
had obtained assistance from the Greek
Emperor at Byzantium in asserting his own
claims. He succeeded in driving Witiza out
of the country; and in 709,&mdash;"the last of the
Goths,"&mdash;was crowned at Toledo, King of
all Spain.</p>

<p>But the struggle was not over; and it was
about to lead to a result which is one of the
most momentous in the history, not alone of
Spain,&mdash;nor yet of Europe,&mdash;but of <i>Christendom</i>.
Witiza was dead, but his two sons, with
a formidable following, were still trying to
work the ruin of Roderick. A certain Count
Julian, who, on account of his daughter Florinda,
had his own wrongs to avenge, accepted
the leadership of these rebels. The power of
the Visigoths had extended across the narrow
strait (cut by the Phenicians) over to the
opposite shore, where Morocco seems to be
reaching out in vain endeavor to touch the
land from which she was long ago severed;
and there, at Tangiers, this arch-traitor laid
his plans and matured the scheme of revenge
and treachery which had such tremendous results
for Europe. With an appearance of perfect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[pg 52]</span>
loyalty he parted from Roderick, who
unsuspectingly asked him to bring him some
hawks from Africa when he returned. Bowing,
he said: "Sire, I will bring you such
hawks as never were seen in Spain before."</p>

<p>For one hundred years an unprecedented
wave of conquest had been moving from Asia
toward the west. Mahommedanism, which
was destined to become the scourge of Christendom,
had subjected Syria, Mesopotamia,
Egypt, and northern Africa, until it reached
Ceuta&mdash;the companion Pillar to Gibraltar on
the African coast.</p>

<p>At this point the Goths had stood, as a protecting
wall beyond which the Asiatic deluge
could not flow.</p>

<p>Count Julian was the trusted military
commander of the Gothic garrisons in Morocco,
as <i>Musa</i>, the oft-defeated Saracen
leader, knew to his cost. As this Musa
was one day looking with covetous eyes
across at the Spanish Peninsula, he was
suddenly surprised by a visit from Count
Julian; and still more astonished when that
commander offered to surrender to him the
Gothic strongholds <i>Tangier</i>, <i>Arsilla</i>, and
<i>Ceuta</i> in return for the assistance of the Saracen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>[pg 53]</span>
army in the cause of Witiza's sons against
Roderick.</p>

<p>Amazed at such colossal treason, Musa referred
Count Julian to his master the Khalif,
at Damascus, who at once accepted his infamous
proposition. In Spanish legend and
history this man is always designated as <i>The
Traitor</i>, as if standing alone and on a pinnacle
among the men who have betrayed their
countries.</p>

<p>Musa, half doubting, sent a preliminary
force of about five hundred Moors under a
chief named <i>Tarif</i>, to the opposite coast; and
the Moors found, as was promised, that they
might range at their own will and pleasure in
that earthly paradise of Andalusia. The
name of this Mussulman chief, Tarif, was
given to the spot first touched by the feet of
the Mahommedan, which was called <i>Tarifa</i>;
and as Tarifa was afterward the place where
customs were collected, the word <i>tariff</i> is an
imperishable memorial of that event. In like
manner Gibraltar was named <i>Gebel-al-Tarik</i>,
(Mountain of Tarik) after the leader bearing
that name, who was sent later by Musa with a
larger force; which name has been gradually
changed to its present form&mdash;Gibraltar.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg 54]</span>

<p>Poor King Roderick, while still fighting to
maintain his own right to the crown he wore,
learned with dismay that his country was invaded
by a horde of people from the African
coast. Theodemir wrote to him: "So
strange is their appearance that we might take
them for inhabitants of the sky. Send me all
the troops you can collect, without delay."
The hawks promised by Count Julian had
arrived!</p>

<p>The hour of doom had sounded for the last
King of the Visigoths, and for his kingdom.
There is a legend that a mysterious tower existed
near Toledo, which was built by Hercules,
soon after Adam, with the command that
no king or lord of Spain should ever seek to
know what it contained; instead of that it was
the duty of each King to put a new lock upon
its mysterious portal.</p>

<p>It is said that Roderick, perhaps in his extremity,
resolved to disobey the command,
and to discover the secret hidden in the Enchanted
Tower. In a jeweled shrine in the
very heart of the structure he came at last to
a coffer of silver, "right subtly wrought," and
far inside of that he reached the final mystery,&mdash;only
this,&mdash;a white cloth folded between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[pg 55]</span>
two pieces of copper. With trembling eagerness
Roderick opened and found painted
thereon men with turbans, carrying banners,
with swords strung around their necks, and
bows behind them, slung at the saddle-bow.
Over these figures was written: "When this
cloth shall be opened, men appareled like
these shall conquer Spain, and be the lords
thereof."</p>

<p>Such is the picturesque legend. Men with
"turbans and banners and swords slung about
their necks," were assuredly now in Andalusia,
led by Tarik, who had literally burned his
ships behind him, and then told his followers
to choose between victory or death.</p>

<p>The two armies faced each other at a spot
near Cadiz. It is said that Roderick, the degenerate
successor of Alaric, went into battle
in a robe of white silk embroidered with gold,
sitting on a car of ivory, drawn by white
mules. Tarik's men, who were fighting for
victory or Paradise, overwhelmed the Goths;
Roderick, in his flight, was drowned in the
Guadalquivir, and his diadem of pearls and his
embroidered robe were sent to Damascus as
trophies.</p>

<p>Count Julian urged that the victory be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[pg 56]</span>
immediately followed up by Musa before there
was time for the Spaniards to rally. One
after another the cities of Toledo, Cordova,
and Granada capitulated, the persecuted Jews
flocking to the new standard and aiding in the
conquest of their oppressors.</p>

<p>As well might one have held back the Atlantic
from rushing through that canal upon
the isthmus, as to have stayed the inflowing of
the Saracens through the breach made by
"the Traitor," Count Julian! In less than
two years Spain was a conquered province,
rendering allegiance to the Khalif at Damascus,
and the <i>Moor</i>,&mdash;as the followers of the
Prophet in Morocco were called,&mdash;reigned in
Toledo.</p>

<p>It was in the year 412 that Ataulfus, with
his haughty bride Placidia, had established his
Court at Barcelona, and Romanized Spain
became Gothic Spain. In 711&mdash;just three
centuries later&mdash;the Visigoth kingdom had
disappeared as utterly beneath the Saracen
flood as had its ill-fated King Roderick under
the waters of the Guadalquivir; and fastened
upon Christian Europe was a Mahommedan
empire; an empire which all the combined
powers of that continent have never since been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[pg 57]</span>
able entirely to dislodge. From that ill-omened
day in 709, when Tarif set foot on the
Spanish coast, to this June of 1898, the
Mahommedan has been in Europe; and remains
to-day, a scourge and a blight in the
territory upon which his cruel grasp still
lingers.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>


<p>Tarik and his twelve thousand Berbers,<a id="footnotetag2" name="footnotetag2"></a><a href=
  "#footnote2"><sup>A</sup></a>
or Moors, had at one stroke won the Spanish
Peninsula. The banner of the Prophet waved
over every one of the ancient and famous
cities in Andalusia, and the turbaned army
had marched through the stubborn north as
far as the Spanish border. As Musa, intoxicated
with success, stood at last upon the
Pyrenees, he saw before him a vision of a subjugated
Europe. The banner of the Prophet
should wave from the Pyrenees to the Baltic!
A mosque should stand where St. Peter's now
stands in Rome! So, step by step, the
Moslems pressed up into Gaul, and in 732
their army had reached Tours.</p>

<p>It was a moment of supreme peril for Christendom.
But, happily, the Franks had what
the Goths had not&mdash;a great leader. Charles
Martel,&mdash;then <i>Maire du Palais</i>, and virtually
King of France, instead of the feeble Lothair,&mdash;led
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[pg 59]</span>
his Franks into what was to be one of
the most decisive of the world's battles; a battle
which would determine whether Europe
should be Christian or Mahommedan.</p>

<p>The tide of infidel invasion had reached its
limits. The strong right arm of Charles dealt
such ponderous blows that the Moslems broke
in confusion, and this savior of Christendom
was thenceforth known as Charles Martel:
"Karl of the Hammer."</p>

<p>After this crushing disaster at Tours the
Moors realized that they were not invincible.
Their vaulting ambition did not again try to
overleap the Pyrenees; and they addressed
themselves to settling affairs in their new
territory.</p>

<p>It has been wisely said that if the Mahommedan
state had been confined within the
borders of Arabia, it would speedily have collapsed.
Islam became a world-wide religion
when it clothed itself with armor, and became
a church militant. It was <i>conquest</i> which
saved the faith of the Prophet. In its home
in Asia the Empire of Mahommed was composed
of hostile tribes and clans, and as it
moved westward it gathered up Syrians,
Egyptians, and the Berbers on the African
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[pg 60]</span>
coast, who, when Morocco was reached, were
known as Moors. This strange, heterogeneous
mass of humanity, all nourished from
Arabia, was held together by two things: the
<i>Koran</i> and the <i>sword</i>.</p>

<p>When conquest was exchanged for peaceful
possession, all the internecine jealousies,
the tribal feuds, and old hatreds burst forth,
and the first fifty years of Moorish rule in
Spain was a period of internal strife and disorder&mdash;Arabs
and Moors were jealously trying
to undermine each other; while the Arabs
themselves were torn by factions representing
rival clans in Damascus.</p>

<p>But a singular clemency was shown toward
the conquered Spaniards. They were permitted
to retain their own law and judges, and
their own governors administered the affairs
of the districts and collected the taxes. The
rule of the conquering race bore upon the people
actually less heavily than had the old
Gothic rule. Jews and Christians alike were
free to worship whom or what they pleased;
but, at the same time, great benefits were bestowed
upon those who would accept the
religion of the Prophet. The slave class,
which was very large and had suffered terrible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>[pg 61]</span>
cruelties under its old masters, was treated
with especial mildness and humanity. There
was a simple road to freedom opened to every
man. He had only to say, "There is one
God, and Mahommed is his Prophet," and on
the instant he became a freeman!</p>

<p>Such gentle proselytizing as this speedily
won converts, not alone among slaves but
from all classes. The pacification of Spain by
the Romans had required centuries; while
only a few years sufficed to make of the vanquished
in the southern provinces, a contented
and almost happy people; not only reconciled,
but even glad of the change of masters.
Never was Andalusia so mildly, justly, and
wisely governed as by her Arab conquerors.</p>

<p>The most delicate of all problems is that of
dealing with a conquered race in its own land.
That this should have been so wisely and so
skillfully handled would be incomprehensible
if this had been really, what it is always
called, a Moorish conquest. But to be accurate,
it was a Moorish invasion and a Saracen
conquest!</p>

<p>The fierce Berber Moor contributed the
brute force, which was wielded by Saracen
intelligence.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[pg 62]</span>

<p>The Saracens were the leaven which penetrated
the whole sodden mass of Mahommedanism.
With a civilization which had been
ripening for centuries under Oriental skies,&mdash;rich
in wisdom, learning, culture, science, and
in art,&mdash;they had come into Europe, infidels
though they were, to build up and not to
destroy.</p>

<p>The Roman conquest of Spain had civilized
a barbarous race. The Gothic conquest
of Romanized Spain had converted
an effete civilization into a strong semi-barbarism.
Now again the Saracen had
come from the East to convert a semi-barbarism
into a civilization richer than
any Spain had yet known, and, more
than that, to hold up a torch of learning
and enlightenment which should illumine
Europe in the days of darkness which were
at hand. Although this difference between
Arab and Moor primarily existed, they became
fused, and we shall speak of them only
as Moors. But we should not lose sight of
the fact that the superior intelligence which
made the Moorish kingdom magnificent was
from the land of the Prophet.</p>

<p>The Saracen dealt gently with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[pg 63]</span>
conquered Spaniard, not because his heart was
tender and kind, but because he was crafty and
wise, and knew when not to use force, in order
to accomplish his ends. For the same reason
he refrained from trying to break the spirit of
the independent northern provinces, where
the descendants of the old Visigoths&mdash;the
Hidalgos ("sons-of-somebody")&mdash;proudly intrenched
themselves in an attitude of defiance,
making in time a clearly defined Christian
north and Moslem south, with a mountain
range (the Sierra Guadarrama) and a river
(the Ebro) as the natural boundary line of the
two territories. The Moor was a child of the
sun. If the stubborn Goth chose to sulk, up
among the chilly heights and on the bleak
plains of the north, he might do so, and it was
little matter if one Alfonso called himself
"King of the Asturians," in that mountain-defended
and sea-girt province. The fertile
plains of Andalusia, and the banks of the
Tagus and Guadalquivir, were all of Spain the
Moor wanted for the wonderful kingdom
which was to be the marvel of the Middle
Ages.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[pg 64]</span>


<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>


<p>But, at the early period we are considering,
the "Christian kingdom" was composed of a
handful of men and women who had fled from
the Moslems to the mountains of the
Asturias. Its one stronghold was the cave of
Covadonga, where Pelagius, or Pelayo, had
gathered thirty men and ten women. Here,
in the dark recesses of this cave,&mdash;which was
approached through a long and narrow mountain
pass, and entered by a ladder of ninety
steps,&mdash;was the germ of the future kingdoms
of Castile and Aragon, and also of the downfall
of the Moor. An Arab historian said
later: "Would to God the Moslems had extinguished
that spark which was destined to
consume the dominion of Islam in the north"
and, he might have added, "<i>in Spain.</i>"</p>

<p>When Alfonso of Cantabria married the
daughter of Pelayo in 751, the cave of Covadonga
no longer held the insurgent band. He
roused all the northern provinces against the
Moors and gathered an army which drove
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[pg 65]</span>
them step by step further south, until he had
pushed the Christian frontier as far as the
great Sierra, so that the one-time Visigoth
capital of Toledo marked the line of the Moslem
border fortresses. Too scanty in numbers
and too poor in purse to occupy the
territory, Alfonso and his army then retreated
to their mountains, there to enjoy the empty
satisfaction of their conquest.</p>

<p>But the Moors in Andalusia had too many
troubles of their own at that time to give
much heed to Alfonso I. and his rebellious
band hiding in the mountains. The Berbers
and the Arabs on the African coast were jealous
and antagonistic; the one was devout,
credulous, and emotional; the other cool,
crafty, and diplomatic. Suddenly the long-slumbering
hatred burst into open revolt, and
the Khalif sent thirty thousand Syrians to put
down a formidable revolution in his African
dominions.</p>

<p>In full sympathy with their kinsmen across
the sea, the Moors in Spain began to realize
that while that land had been won by twelve
thousand Berbers, led by one Berber general,
that the lion's share of the spoils had gone to
the Arabs, who were carrying things with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>[pg 66]</span>
high hand! There were signs of a general uprising,
in concert with the revolution in
Africa; and it looked as if the new territory
was to be given up to anarchy; when suddenly
all was changed.</p>

<p>The Khalif, who was the head of all the
Mahommedan empire, was supposed to be the
supreme ruler in spiritual and temporal
affairs. But as his empire extended to such
vast dimensions, he was obliged to delegate
much of his temporal authority to others; so
gradually it had become somewhat like that of
the Pope. He was the supreme spiritual
head, and only nominally supreme in affairs of
state.</p>

<p>The family of <i>Omeyyad</i> had given fourteen
Khalifs to the Mahommedan empire from 661
to 750; at which time the then reigning
Omeyyad was deposed, and the second
dynasty of Khalifs commenced, called <i>Abbaside</i>,
after Abbas, an uncle of the Prophet.</p>

<p>Abd-er-Rahman was a Prince belonging to
the deposed family of the Omeyyads. He
was the only one of his family who escaped the
exterminating fury of the Abbasides. There
was no future for him in the east, so the
thoughts of the ambitious youth turned to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[pg 67]</span>
the west&mdash;to the newly won territory of
Spain.</p>

<p>The coming of this last survivor of the
Omeyyads to Andalusia is one of the romances
of history, and was not unlike the
coming of another young Pretender to Scotland,
one thousand years later. It aroused
the same wild enthusiasm, and as if by magic
an army gathered about him, to meet the
army of the Governor, Yusuf, which would
resist him. Victory declared itself for the
Prince, and he entered Cordova in triumph.
Before the year had expired the dynasty of the
Omeyyads&mdash;which was to stand for three
centuries&mdash;was finally established, and its first
king&mdash;Abd-er-Rahman&mdash;reigned at Cordova.</p>

<p>His hereditary enemies the Abbasides followed
him to Spain, and found supporters
among the disaffected. But it was in vain.
The Abbaside army of invasion was utterly
annihilated; and the qualities slumbering in
this son of the Khalifs may be judged when
we relate that the heads of the Abbaside
leaders were put into a bag with descriptive
labels attached to their ears, and sent to the
reigning Khalif as a present.</p>

<p>This little incident does not seem to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[pg 68]</span>
injured him in the estimation of Mansur, the
new Khalif, who said of him: "Wonderful
is this man! Such daring, wisdom, prudence!
To throw himself into a distant land;
to profit by the jealousies of the people;
to turn their arms against one another instead
of against himself; to win homage and obedience
through such difficulties; and to rule
supreme&mdash;lord of all! Of a truth there is not
such another man!" Abd-er-Rahman (the
Sultan, as he was called) merited this praise.
He knew when to be cruel and when to show
mercy; and how to hold scheming Arab chiefs,
fierce, jealous Berbers, and vanquished Christians,
and could placate or crucify as the conditions
required.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[pg 69]</span>




<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>


<p>Charlemagne was at this time building
up his colossal empire. His Christian soul was
mightily stirred by seeing an infidel kingdom
set up in Andalusia; and when, in 777, the
Saracen governor and two other Arab chiefs
appealed to him for aid against the Omeyyad
usurper, Abd-er-Rahman, he eagerly responded.
His grandfather Charles Martel
had driven these infidels back over the Pyrenees;
now he would drive them out of Spain,
and reclaim that land for Christianity!</p>

<p>His army never reached farther than Saragossa.
He was recalled to France by a revolt
of the recently conquered Saxons, and the
"Battle of Roncesvalles" is the historic
monument of the ill-starred attempt. The
battle in itself was insignificant. No action
of such small importance has ever been invested
with such a glamour of romance,
nor the theme of so much legend and
poetry. It has been called the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>[pg 70]</span>
Thermopyl&#230; of the Pyrenees, because of the
personal valor displayed, and the tragic
death of the two great Paladins (as the
twelve Peers of Charlemagne were called)
Roland and Olivier. The <i>Chanson de Roland</i>
was one of the famous ballads in the early
literature of Europe, and Roland and Olivier
were to French and Spanish minstrelsy what
the knights of King Arthur were to the English.</p>

<p>The simple story about which so much has
been written and sung is this: As the retreating
army of Charlemagne was crossing the
Pyrenees, the rear of the army under Roland
and Olivier was ambuscaded in the narrow
pass of Roncesvalles by the Basques and exterminated
to a man.</p>

<p>These Basques were the unconquerable
mountain tribe of which we heard so much in
the early history of Spain. They had been on
guard for centuries, keeping the Franks back
from the Pyrenees. They may have been acting
under Saracenic influence when they exterminated
the rear-guard of Charlemagne's
army. But it was done, not because they
loved the Saracen, but because they had a
hereditary hatred for the Franks.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>[pg 71]</span>

<p>Medi&#230;val Europe never tired of hearing of
the Great Charles' lament over his Roland:
"O thou right arm of my kingdom,&mdash;defender
of the Christians,&mdash;scourge of the
Saracens! How can I behold thee dead, and
not die myself! Thou art exalted to the
heavenly kingdom,&mdash;and I am left alone, a
poor miserable King!"</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[pg 72]</span>




<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>


<p>The tide which had flowed over southern
Spain was a singular mixture of religious fervor,
of brutish humanity, and refinements of
wisdom and wickedness. No stranger and
more composite elements were ever thrown
together. Permanence and peace were impossible.
Nothing but force could hold together
elements so incongruous and antagonistic.
As soon as the hand of Abd-er-Rahman
I. was removed disintegration began.
Clashing races, clans, and political parties had
in a few years made such havoc that it seemed
as if the Omeyyad dynasty was crumbling.</p>

<p>It might have been an Arab who said "he
cared not who made the laws of his country,
so he could write its songs." Learning, literature,
refinements of luxury and of art had
taken possession of the land, which seemed
given up to the muses. When in 822
Abd-er-Rahman II. reigned, he did not trouble
himself about the laws of his crumbling empire.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>[pg 73]</span>
The one man in whom he delighted was
<i>Ziryab</i>. What Petronius was to Nero,<a id="footnotetag3" name="footnotetag3"></a><a href=
  "#footnote3"><sup>A</sup></a> and
Beau Brummel to George IV., that was
Ziryab to the Sultan Abd-er-Rahman II., the
elegant arbiter in matters of taste. From the
dishes which should be eaten to the clothes
which should be worn, he was the supreme
judge; while at the same time he knew by
heart and could "like an angel sing" one
thousand songs to his adoring Sultan.</p>

<p>Even the Gothic Christians were seduced
by these alluring refinements. They felt contempt
for their old Latin speech and for their
literature, with the tiresome asceticism it
eternally preached. The Christian ideal had
grown to be one of penance and mortification
of the flesh, and to a few ardent souls these
sensuous delights were an open highway to
death eternal. <i>Eulogius</i> became the leader of
this band of zealots. In lamenting the decadence
of his people, he wrote, "hardly one in
a thousand can write a decent Latin letter, and
yet they indite excellent Arabic verse!"
Filled with despairing ardor this man aroused
a few kindred spirits to join him in a desperate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[pg 74]</span>
attempt to awaken the benumbed conscience
of the Christians. They could not get
the Moslems to persecute them, but they
might attain martyrdom by cursing the
Prophet; then the infidels, however reluctant,
would be compelled to behead them. This
they did, and one by one perished, to no purpose.
The Gothic Christians were not conscience-stricken
as Eulogius supposed they
would be, and there was no general uprising
for the Christian faith.</p>

<p>In 912 the threatened ruin of the dynasty
was arrested by the coming of another Abd-er-Rahman,
third Sultan of that name. Rebellion
was put down, and fifty years of wise and
just administration gave solidity to the kingdom,
which also then became a <i>Khalifate</i>.</p>

<p>The Abbaside Khalifs, after the deposition
of the Omeyyads, had removed the Khalifate
from Damascus to Baghdad. But the empire
had extended too far west to revolve about
that distant pivot. Abd-er-Rahman&mdash;perhaps
remembering the old feud between his family
and the Abbasides&mdash;determined to assume
the spiritual headship of the western part
of the empire. And thereafter, the Mahommedan
empire&mdash;like the Roman&mdash;had two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>[pg 75]</span>
heads, an Eastern Khalif at Baghdad, and a
Western Khalif at Cordova.</p>

<p>While thus extending his own power the
Khalif was extinguishing every spark of rebellion
in the south and driving the rebellious
Christians back in the north, and at the same
time he was clothing Cordova with a splendor
which amazed and dazzled even the Eastern
Princes who came to pay court to the great
Khalif. His emissaries were everywhere collecting
books for his library and treasure for
his palaces. Cordova became the abode of
learning, and the nursery for science, philosophy,
and art, transplanted from Asia. The imagination
and the pen of an arab poet could
not have overdrawn this wonderful city on the
Guadalquivir,&mdash;with its palaces, its gardens,
and fountains,&mdash;its 50,000 houses of the aristocracy,&mdash;its
700 mosques,&mdash;and 900 public
baths,&mdash;all adorned with color and carvings
and tracery beautiful as a dream of Paradise.
One hears with amazement of the great
mosque, with its 19 arcades, its pavings of
silver and rich mosaics, its 1293 clustered
columns, inlaid with gold and lapis-lazuli, the
clusters reaching up to the slender arches
which supported the roof; the whole of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>[pg 76]</span>
marvelous scene lighted by countless brazen
lamps made from Christian bells, while
hundreds of attendants swung censers, filling
the air with perfume.</p>

<p>After the ravages of a thousand years travelers
stand amazed to-day before the forest of
columns which open out in endless vistas in
the splendid ruin, calling up visions of
the vanished glories of Cordova and the Great
Khalif.</p>

<p>There is not time to tell of the city this
Spanish Khalif built for his favorite wife,
"The Fairest," and which he called "Hill of
the Bride," upon which for fifteen years ten
thousand men worked daily; nor of the four
thousand columns which adorned its palaces,
presents from emperors and potentates in
Constantinople, Rome, and far-off Eastern
states; nor of the ivory and ebony doors,
studded with jewels, through which shone the
sun, the light then falling on the lake of quick-silver,
which sent back blinding, quivering
flashes into dazzled eyes. And we are told of
the thirteen thousand male servants who ministered
in this palace of delight. All this, too,
at a time when our Saxon ancestors were living
in dwellings without chimneys, and casting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[pg 77]</span>
the bones from the table at which they
feasted into the foul straw which covered their
floors; when a Gothic night had settled
upon Europe, and blotted out civilization so
completely that only in a part of Italy, and
around Constantinople, did there remain a
vestige of refinement!</p>

<p>It is said that when the embassy from Constantinople
came bearing a letter to the Khalif,
the courtier whose duty it was to read it
was so awed by all this splendor that he
fainted!</p>

<p>And yet the owner and creator of this fabulous
luxury,&mdash;Sultan and Khalif of a dominion
the greatest of his time, and with "The Fairest"
for his adored wife,&mdash;when he came to
die, left a paper upon which he had written
that he could only recall fourteen days in
which he had been happy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>


<p>In the north there was developing another
and very different power. The descendants
of the Visigoth Kings, making common cause
with the rough mountaineers, had shared all
their hardships and rigors in the mountains of
the Asturias. Inured to privation and suffering,
entirely unacquainted with luxury or
even with the comforts of living, they had
grown strong, and in a century after Alfonso
I. had emerged from their mountain shelter
and removed their court and capital from
Oviedo to Leon, where Alfonso III. held sway
over a group of barren kingdoms, poor,
proud, but with <i>Hidalgos</i> and <i>Dons</i>, who were
keeping alive the sacred fires of patriotism and
of religion. This was the rough cradle of a
Spanish nationality.</p>

<p>They had their own jealousies and fierce
conflicts, but all united in a common hatred
of the Moor. Though they did not yet
dream of driving him out of their land, their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>[pg 79]</span>
brave leaders, Ramiro I. and Ordo&#241;o I.
had been for years steadily defying and tormenting
him with the kind of warfare to
which they gave its name&mdash;<i>guerrilla</i>&mdash;meaning
"little wars."</p>

<p>While the Great Khalif was consolidating
his Moorish kingdom and driving the Christians
back into their mountains, the power of
that people was being weakened by internal
strifes existing between the three adjacent
kingdoms&mdash;Leon, Castile, and Navarre. The
headship of Leon was for years disputed by
her ambitious neighbor Castile (so called because
of the numerous fortified castles with
which it was studded), under the leadership
of one Fernando, Count of Castile.</p>

<p>There had been the usual lapse into anarchy
and weakness after the Great Khalif's death.
Andalusia always needed a master, and this
she found in <i>Almanzor</i>, who was Prime Minister
to one of the Khalif's feeble descendants.
It was a sad day for the struggling kingdom
in the north when this all-subduing man took
the reins in his own hands, and left his young
master to amuse himself in collecting rare
manuscripts and making Cordova more beautiful.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[pg 80]</span>

<p>This Almanzor, the mightiest of the soldiers
of the Crescent since Tarik and Musa,
proclaimed a war of faith against the Christians,
who were obliged to forget their local
dissensions and to try with their combined
strength to save their kingdom from extermination.
These were the darkest days to
which they had yet been subjected. But for
the death of Almanzor the ruin of the Christian
state would have been complete. A
monkish historian thus records this welcome
event: "In 1002 died Almanzor, and
was buried in hell."</p>

<p>The death of Almanzor was the turning
point in the fortunes of the two kingdoms&mdash;that
of the Moors and of the Christians.</p>

<p>The magnificence and the glory of the
kingdom faded like the mist before the morning
sun. Never again would Cordova be
called the "Bride of Andalusia." Eight years
after the death of Almanzor anarchy and ruin
reigned in that city. The gentle, studious
youth who was Khalif, was dragged with his
only child to a dismal vault attached to the
great mosque; and here, in darkness and cold
and damp, sat the grandson of the first Great
Khalif, his child clinging to his breast and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>[pg 81]</span>
begging in vain for food, his wretched father
pathetically pleading with his jailers for just
a crust of bread, and a candle to relieve the
awful darkness.</p>

<p>The brutal Berbers now had their turn. The
priceless library, with its six hundred thousand
volumes, was in ashes. They were in
the "City of the Fairest." Palace after palace
was ransacked, and in a few days all that
remained of its exquisite treasures of art
was a heap of blackened stones (1010). The
Christians drew their broken state closer together,
and gathered themselves for a more
aggressive warfare than any yet undertaken.
The time when the Moors were in the throes
of civil war was favorable. The three kingdoms
of Asturias, Leon, and Castile were in
1073 united into one "kingdom of Castile,"
under Alfonso VI., who had already made
great inroads upon the Moslem territory and
laid many cities under tribute. With this
event, the name <i>Castilian</i> comes into Spanish
history, and from thenceforth that name represents
all that is proudest, bravest, and most
characteristic of the part of the race which
traces a direct lineage from the ancient Visigoth
Kings.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>[pg 82]</span>

<p>Alfonso had not misjudged his opportunity.
He had traversed Spain with his army, and
bathed in the ocean in sight of the "Pillars of
Hercules." His great general Rodrigo Diaz,
known as "My Cid, the Challenger," had cut
another path all the way to Valencia, where
he reigned as a sort of uncrowned king; and
he will forever reign as crowned king in the
realm of romance and poetry; the perfect embodiment
of the knightly idea&mdash;the "Challenger,"
who, in defense of the faith, would
stand before great armies and defy them to
single combat! Whether "My Cid" ever
did such mighty deeds as are ascribed to him,
no one knows. But he stands for the highest
ideal of his time. He was the "King Arthur"
of Spanish history; and so valiantly did
he serve the Christian cause that the Moors
were driven to a most disastrous step. With
the Cid in Valencia, with Alfonso VI. marching
a victorious army through the Moslem
territory, and with Toledo, the city of the
ancient Visigoth Kings, repossessed, it looked
as if, after almost four hundred years, the
Christians were about to recover their
land.</p>

<p>The Moors, thoroughly frightened, realizing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>[pg 83]</span>
how helpless they had grown, resolved
upon a desperate measure.</p>

<p>There was, on the opposite African coast,
a sect of Berber fanatics, fierce and devout,
known as "saints," but which the Moors
called <i>Almoravides</i>. Fighting for the faith
was their occupation. What more fitting
than to use them as a means of driving the infidel
Christians out of Moslem territory!</p>

<p>They came, like a cloud of locusts, and settled
upon the land. Yusuf, their general, led
his men against Alfonso's Castilians October
23, 1086. Near Badajos the attack was made
simultaneously in front and rear, crushing
them utterly; Alfonso barely escaping with
five hundred men. This was only the first of
many other crushing defeats; the most disheartening
of which was the one in 1099, when
the Cid, fighting in alliance with Pedro, King
of Aragon, was defeated near Gardia, on the
seacoast. Then the great warrior's heart
broke, and he died; and we are told he was
clothed cap-&#224;-pie in shining armor and placed
upright on his good steed Bavieca, his trusty
sword in his hand&mdash;and so he passed to his
burial; his banner borne and guarded by five
hundred knights. And we are also told the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[pg 84]</span>
Moors wonderingly watched his departure
with his knights, not suspecting that he was
dead.</p>

<p>The object of the Moors in inviting the
odious Almoravides had been accomplished;
the Christians had been driven out of Andalusia
back into their own territory; but their
African auxiliaries were too well pleased with
their new abode to think of leaving it. One
by one the Moorish Princes were subdued by
the men whose aid they had invoked, until a
dynasty of the Almoravides was fastened upon
Spain. To the refined Spanish Arabs contact
with these savages from the desert was a
terrible scourge, and so far as they were able
they withdrew into communities by themselves,
leaving these African locusts to devour
their substance and dim their glory.</p>

<p>But luxury was not favorable to the invaders.
In another generation their martial
spirit was gone and they had become only
ignorant, sodden voluptuaries; and when the
Christians once more renewed their attacks,
they failed to repel them as Yusuf had done
thirty years before.</p>

<p>There was another fanatical sect, beyond
the Atlas range in Africa, which had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[pg 85]</span>
long been looking for a coming Messiah,
whom they called the <i>Mahdi</i>. They were
known as the <i>Alhomades</i>. A son of a lamp-lighter
in the Mosque of Cordova one day presented
himself before the Alhomades, and announced
that he was the great <i>Mahdi</i>, who was
divinely appointed to lead them, and to bring
happiness to all the earth.</p>

<p>The path this <i>Mahdi</i> desired to lead them
was first to Morocco, there to subdue the Almoravides
in their own land, and thence to
Spain. In a short time this entire plan was
realized. The Mahdi's successor was Emperor
of Morocco, and by the year 1150 included in
his dominion was all of Mahommedan Spain!
The Spanish Arabs, when they were fighting
Alfonso VI. and the "Cid," did not anticipate
this disgraceful downfall from people of
their own faith. They abhorred these Mahommedan
savages, and drew together still
closer for a century more in and about their
chosen refuge of Granada.</p>

<p>In the early part of the thirteenth century
the Emperor of Morocco made such enormous
preparations for the occupation of Spain
that a larger design upon Europe became
manifest. Once more Christendom was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>[pg 86]</span>
alarmed; not since Charles Martel had the
danger appeared so great. The Pope proclaimed
a Crusade, this time not into Palestine, but Spain.</p>

<p>An army of volunteers from the kingdom of
Portugal and from southern France re-enforced
the great armies of the Kings of Castile,
Aragon, and Navarre. The Crusaders, as
they called themselves, assembled at Toledo
July 12, 1212, under the command of Alfonso
IX., King of Castile. The power of the Alhomades
was broken, and they were driven
out of Spain. The once great Mahommedan
Empire in that country was reduced to the
single province of Granada, where the Moors
intrenched themselves in their last stronghold.
For nearly three centuries the Crescent was
yet to wave over the kingdom of Granada;
but it was to shine in only the pale light of a
waning crescent, until its final extinction in
the full light of a Christian day.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[pg 87]</span>




<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>


<p>A great change had been wrought in
Europe. The Crusades had opened a channel
through which flowed from the East reviving
streams of ancient knowledge and culture
over the arid waste of medi&#230;valism. France
and England had awakened from their long
mental torpor, Paris was become the center of
an intellectual revival. In England, Roger
Bacon, in his "Opus Majus," was systematizing
all existing knowledge and laying a
foundation for a more advanced science and
philosophy for the people, who had only
recently extorted from their wicked King
John the great charter of their liberties.</p>

<p>It was just at this period, when the door had
suddenly opened ushering Europe into a new
life, that the Christian cause in Spain triumphed;
and, excepting in the little kingdom
of Granada, the Cross waved from the Pyrenees
to the sea. After more than four centuries
of steadfast devotion to that object, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>[pg 88]</span>
descendants of the Visigoth Kings had come
once more into their inheritance.</p>

<p>They found it enriched, and clothed with a
beauty of which their ancestors could never
have dreamed. These Spaniards had learned
their lesson of valor in the north, and they
had learned it well. Now in the land of the
Moor, dwelling in the palaces they had built,
and gazing upon masterpieces of Arabic art
and architecture which they had left, they
were to learn the subtle charm of form and
color, and the fascination which music and
poetry and beauty and knowledge may lend
to life. As they drank from these Moorish
fountains the rugged warriors found them
very sweet; and they discovered that there
were other pleasures in life beside fighting the
Moors and nursing memories of the Cid and
their vanished heroes.</p>

<p>The territory of Fernando III., King of Castile
(1230-52), extended now from the Bay of
Biscay to the Guadalquivir. The ancient city
of Seville was chosen as his capital. It was a
far cry from the "Cave of Covadonga"
to the Moorish palace of the "Alcazar," where
dwelt the pious descendant of Pelayo! The
first act of Fernando III. was to convert the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[pg 89]</span>
Mosque at Seville into a cathedral, which
still stands with its Moorish bell-tower, the
beautiful "Giralda." There may also be seen
to-day over one of its portals a stuffed crocodile,
which was sent alive to King Ferdinand
by the Sultan of Egypt. And within the
cathedral, in a silver urn with glass sides, the
traveler may also gaze to-day upon the remains
of this "Saint Ferdinand" clothed in
royal robes, and with a crown upon his head.</p>

<p>Spain had begun to lift up her head among
the other nations of Europe. To defeat the
Crescent was the highest ideal of that chivalric
age. Spain, longer than any other nation,
had fought the Mahommedan. It had been
her sole occupation for four centuries, and
now she had vanquished him, and driven
him into the mountains of one of her
smallest provinces, there to hide from the
Spaniards as they had once hidden from the
Moors in the North. This was a passport
to the honor and respect of other Christian
nations. She was Spain "the Catholic"&mdash;the
loved and favorite child of the
Church&mdash;and great monarchs in England,
France, and Germany bestowed their sons and
daughters upon her kings and princes. Poor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>[pg 90]</span>
though she was in purse, and somewhat rude
yet in manners, she held up her head high in
proud consciousness of her aristocratic lineage,
and her unmatched championship of
Christianity.</p>

<p>We realize how close had become the tie
binding her to other nations when we learn
that King Fernando III. was the grandson
of Queen Eleanor of England (daughter of
Henry II.), and that Louis IX. of France,
that other royal saint, was his own cousin;
and also that his wife Beatrix, whom he
brought with him to Seville, was daughter
of Frederick II., Emperor of Germany.</p>

<p>The deep hold which Arabic life and
thought had taken upon their conquerors was
shown when Alfonso X., son of Ferdinand,
came to the throne. So in love was he with
learning and science that he let his kingdom
fall into utter confusion while he busied himself
with a set of astronomical tables upon
which his heart was set and in holding up to
ridicule the Ptolemaic theory. If he had
given less thought to the stars, and more to
the humble question as to who was to be his
successor, it would have saved much strife and
suffering to those who came after him.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>[pg 91]</span>

<p>While the Moslems were building up their
kingdom and making of their capital city a
second and even more beautiful Cordova, there
was a partial truce with the Moors in Granada.
Moors and Christians were enemies still; the
hereditary hatreds were only lulled into temporary
repose. But Christian knights who
were handsome and gallant might love and
woo Moorish maidens who were beautiful;
and, as a writer has intimated, love became
the business and war the pastime of the Spaniard
in Andalusia. Spain was unconsciously
inbibing the soft, sensuous charm of the civilization
she was exterminating; and the peculiar
rhythm of Spanish music, and the subtle
picturesqueness which makes the Spanish people
unique among the other Latin nations of
Europe, came, not from her Gothic, nor her
Roman, nor her Phenician ancestry, but from
the plains of Arabia; and the guitar and the
dance and the castanet, and the charm and
the coquetry of her women, are echoes from
that far-off land of poetry and romance. Not
so the bull-fight! Would you trace to its
source that pleasant pastime, you must not
go to the East; the Oriental was cruel to man,
but not to beast. He would have abhorred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[pg 92]</span>
such a form of amusement, for the origin of
which we must look to the barbarous Kelt;
or perhaps, as is more probable, to the mysterious
Iberians, since among the Latin peoples
of Europe bull-fighting is found in Spain
alone. Well was it for Spain that her rough,
untutored ancestors were kept hiding in the
mountains for centuries, while that brilliant
Oriental race planted their Peninsula thick
with the germs of high thinking and beautiful
living.</p>

<p>As the spider, after his glistening habitation
has been destroyed by some ruthless footstep,
goes patiently to work to rebuild it, so the
Moor in Granada, with his imperishable instinct
for beauty, was making of his little kingdom
the most beautiful spot in Europe. The
city of Granada was lovelier than Cordova;
its Alhambra more enchanting than had been
the palaces in the "City of the Fairest."
This citadel, which is fortress and palace in
one, still stands like the Acropolis, looking
out upon the plain from its lofty elevation.
Volumes have been written about its labyrinthine
halls and corridors and courts, and
the amazing richness of decoration, which still
survives&mdash;an inexhaustible mine for artists
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>[pg 93]</span>
and a shrine for lovers of the beautiful. But
Granada cultivated other things besides the
art of beauty. Nowhere in Europe was there
in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries such
advanced thinking, and a knowledge so akin
to our own to-day, as within the borders of
that Moorish kingdom.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>[pg 94]</span>




<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>


<p>There were other reasons beside the growing
peacefulness of the Spaniards why Granada
was left to develop in comparative security
for two centuries. It was impossible that
adjacent ambitious kingdoms, such as Navarre,
Castile, Aragon, Leon, and Portugal,
with indefinite and disputed boundaries, and,
on account of intermarriages between the
kingdoms, with indefinite and disputed successions,
should ever be at peace. In the
perpetual strife and warfare which prevailed
on account of royal European alliances, the
fate of foreign princes and princesses were
often involved, and hence European states
stood ready to take a hand.</p>

<p>Castile and Aragon had gradually absorbed
the smaller states, excepting Portugal on the
one side and Navarre on the other. The history
of Spain at this time is a history of the
struggles of these two states for supremacy.
The most eventful as well as the most lurid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>[pg 95]</span>
period of this prolonged civil war was while
Pedro the Cruel was king of Castile, 1350-69.
This Spanish Nero, when sixteen years
old, commenced his reign by the murder of
his mother. A catalogue of his crimes is impossible.
Enough to say that assassination
was his remedy, and means of escape, from
every entanglement in which his treacheries
involved him. It was the unhappy fate of
Blanche de Bourbon, sister of Charles V.,
King of France, to marry this King of Castile,
and when he refused to live with her and had
her removed from his palace the Alcazar to a
fortress, and finally poisoned her, the French
King determined to avenge the insult to his
royal house. He allied himself with the King
of Aragon to destroy Pedro, with whom the
King of Aragon was of course at war.</p>

<p>Edward, the "Black Prince," was then
brilliantly invading France and extending the
kingdom of his father Edward III. He was
the kinsman of Pedro, and when appealed to
by his cousin for aid in protecting his kingdom
from the King of Aragon and his French
allies, Edward gallantly consented to help
him; and in the spring of 1367, for the second
time, a splendid army advanced through the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>[pg 96]</span>
Pass at Roncesvalles, and a great battle,
worthy of a better cause, was fought and
won.</p>

<p>So this most atrocious king&mdash;perhaps excepting
Richard III. of England, whom he
resembled&mdash;had for his champion the victor of
Cressy and Poictiers. He was restored to his
throne, which had been usurped by his brother
Enrique (or Henry), but in a personal encounter
with Enrique soon after (which was
artfully brought about by the famous Breton
knight, Bertrand du Guesclin), he met a deserved
fate (1369).</p>

<p>Constanza, the daughter of Pedro the Cruel,
had been married to John of Gaunt (Duke of
Lancester), brother of the Black Prince and
son of Edward III. As Constanza was the
great-grandmother of Isabella I. of Spain, so
in the veins of that revered Queen there
flowed the blood of the Plantagenets, as well
as that of Pedro the Cruel!</p>

<p>Because of the number of doubtful pretenders
always existing in Spain, disputes about
the royal succession also always existed.
Such a dispute now led to a long war with
Portugal, where King Fernando had really the
most valid hereditary claim to the throne
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>[pg 97]</span>
made vacant by Pedro's death. If his right
had been acknowledged, Portugal and Spain
would now be united; Isabella would have remained
only a poor and devout princess, and
would never have had the power to win a continent
for the world. So impossible is it to
remove one of the links forged by fate, that
we dare not regret even so monstrous a reign
as that of Pedro the Cruel!</p>

<p>Enrique's right to the vacant throne of his
brother had two disputants. Besides the
King of Portugal, John of Gaunt, who had
married the lady Constanza,&mdash;by virtue of her
rights as daughter of Pedro,&mdash;claimed the
crown of Castile. This Plantagenet was actually
proclaimed King of Castile and Leon
(1386). For twenty-five years he vainly
strove to come into his kingdom as sovereign;
but finally compromised by giving his young
daughter Catherine to the boy "Prince of
Asturias," the heir to the throne. He was
obliged to content himself by thus securing to
his child the long-coveted prize. And it was
this Catherine, who at fourteen was betrothed
to a boy of nine, who was the grandmother of
Isabella, Queen of Castile.</p>

<p>When such was the private history of those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>[pg 98]</span>
highest in the land we can only imagine
what must have been that of the rest. Feudalism,
which was a part of Spain's Gothic inheritance,
had always made that country one
of its strongholds, and chivalry had nowhere
else found so congenial a soil. There was no
great artisan class, as in France, creating a
powerful "bourgeoisie"; no "guilds," or simple
"burghers," as in Germany, stubbornly
standing for their rights; no "boroughs" and
"town meetings," where the people were
sternly guarding their liberties, as in England.</p>

<p>The history of other nations is that of the
struggles of the common people against the
tyranny of kings and rulers. If there were
any "common people" in Spain, they were
so effaced that history makes no mention of
them. We hear only of kings and great
barons and glorious knights; and their wonderful
deeds and their valor and prowess&mdash;excepting
in the wars with the Moors&mdash;were
always over boundary-lines and successions,
or personal quarrels more or less disgraceful,
with never a single high purpose or a principle
involved. It was all a gay, ambitious pageant,
adorned by a mantle of chivalry, and made
sacred by the banner of the Cross. In the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>[pg 99]</span>
history of no other European country do we
see a great state develop under despotism so
unredeemed by wholesome ideals, and so unmitigated
and unrestrained by gentle human
impulses.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[pg 100]</span>




<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>


<p>Juan II., the son of the young Catherine and
the boy prince of the Asturias, died in 1454,
and his son Enrique (or Henry) IV. was King
of Castile. When, after some years, Henry
was without children, and with health very infirm,
his young sister Isabella unexpectedly
found herself the acknowledged heir to the
throne of Castile. She suddenly became a
very important young person. The old King
of Portugal was a suitor for her hand,
and a brother of the King of England,
and also a brother of the King of
France, were striving for the same honor.
But Isabella had very decided views of her
own. Her hero was the young Ferdinand of
Aragon, and heir to that throne. She resisted
all her brother's efforts to coerce her, and
finally took the matter into her own hands by
sending an envoy to her handsome young
lover to come to her at Valladolid, with a
letter telling him they had better be married
at once.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg 101]</span>

<p>Accompanied by a few knights disguised as
merchants, Ferdinand, pretending to be their
servant, during the entire journey waited
on them at table and took care of their mules.
He entered Valladolid, where he was received
by the Archbishop of Toledo, who was in the
conspiracy, and was by him conveyed to Isabella's
apartments. We are told that when he
entered someone exclaimed: <i>Ese-es, Ese-es</i>
(that is he); and the escutcheon of the descendants
of that knight has ever since borne a double
<i>S.S.</i>, which sounds like this exclamation.</p>

<p>The marriage was arranged to take place in
four days. An embarrassment then occurred
of which no one had before thought. Neither
of them had any money. But someone was
found who would lend them enough for the
wedding expenses, and so on the 19th of
October, 1469, the most important marriage
ever yet consummated in Spain took place&mdash;a
marriage which would forever set at rest the
rivalries between Castile and Aragon, and
bring honors undreamed of to a united Spain.</p>

<p>Isabella was fair, intelligent, accomplished,
and lovely. She was eighteen and her boy
husband was a year younger. Of course her
royal brother stormed and raged. But, of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>[pg 102]</span>
course, it did no good. In five years from
that time (1474) he died, and Isabella, royally
attired, and seated on a white palfrey, proceeded
to the throne prepared for her, and
was there proclaimed "Queen of Castile."
At the end of another five years, Ferdinand
came into his inheritance. His old father,
Juan II., King of Aragon and Navarre, died
in 1479, and Castile, Aragon, and Navarre&mdash;all
of Spain except Portugal and Granada&mdash;had
come under the double crown of Ferdinand
and Isabella.</p>

<p>The war with Portugal still existed, and
their reign began in the midst of confusion
and trouble, but it was brilliant from the outset.
Ferdinand had great abilities and an
ambition which matched his abilities. Isabella,
no less ambitious than he, was more far-reaching
in her plans, and always saw more
clearly than Ferdinand what was for the true
glory of Spain. With infinite tact she softened
his asperities, and disarmed his jealousy,
and ruled her "dear lord," by making
him believe he ruled her.</p>

<p>A joint sovereignty, with a man so grasping
of power and so jealous of his own rights, required
self-control and tact in no ordinary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[pg 103]</span>
measure. It was agreed at last that in all public
acts Ferdinand's name should precede hers;
and although her sanction was necessary, his
indignation at this was abated by her promise
of submission to his will. The court of the
new sovereigns was established at Seville, and
they took up their abode in that palace so
filled with associations both Moorish and
Castilian&mdash;the Alcazar. From the very first
Isabella's powerful mind grappled every public
question, and she gave herself heart and
soul to what she believed was her divine mission&mdash;the
building up of a great Catholic state.
Isabella's devout soul was sorely troubled
by the prevalence of Judaism in her kingdom.
She took counsel with her confessor,
and also with the Pope, and by their advice a
religious tribunal was established at Seville in
1483, the object of which was to inquire of
heretics whether they were willing to renounce
their faith and accept Christianity.
The head of this tribunal, which was soon followed
by others in all the large cites, was a
Dominican friar called <i>Torquemada</i>. He was
known as the "Inquisitor General." Inaccessible
to pity, mild in manners, humble in
demeanor, yet swayed only by a sense of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>[pg 104]</span>
duty, this strange being was so cruel that he
seems like an incarnation of the evil principle.
At the tribunal in Seville alone it is said that
in thirty-six years four thousand victims were
consigned to the flames, besides the thousands
more who endured living deaths by torture,
mutilation, and nameless sufferings.</p>

<p>Humanity shudders at the recital! And
yet this monstrous tribunal was the creation of
one of the wisest and gentlest of women, who
believed no rigors could be too great to save
people from eternal death! And, in her misguided
zeal, she emptied her kingdom of a people
who had helped to create its prosperity,
and drove the most valuable part of her population
into France, Italy, and England, there
to disseminate the seeds of a higher culture
and intelligence which they had imbibed from
contact with the Moors, who had treated them
with such uniform tolerance and gentleness.</p>

<p>The kingdom of Granada was now at the
height of its splendor. Its capital city was
larger and richer than any city in Spain. Its
army was the best equipped of any in Europe.
The Moorish king, a man of fiery temper,
thought the time had come when he
might defy his enemy by refusing to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[pg 105]</span>
pay an annual tribute to which his father
had ten years before consented. When
Ferdinand's messenger, in 1476, came to
demand the accustomed tribute, he said,
"Go tell your master the kings who
pay tribute in Granada are all dead. Our
mints coin nothing but sword-blades
now."</p>

<p>The cool and crafty Ferdinand prepared his
own answer to this challenge. The infatuated
King Abdul-Hassan followed up his insult
by capturing the Christian fortress of Zahara.
His temper was not at the best at this time on
account of a war raging in his own household.
His wife Ayesha was fiercely jealous of a
Christian captive whom he had also made his
wife. She had become his favorite Sultana,
and was conspiring to have her own son supplant
Boabdil, the son of Ayesha, the heir to
the throne. In his championship of Zoraya
and her son, Abdul-Hassan imprisoned Ayesha
and Boabdil, whom he threatened to disinherit.
We are shown to-day the window in
the Alhambra from which Ayesha lowered
Boabdil in a basket, telling him to come back
with an army and assert his rights. Suddenly,
while absorbed by this smaller war,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[pg 106]</span>
news came that Alhama, their most impregnable
fortress, only six leagues from the
city of Granada, had been captured by
Ferdinand's army. It was the key to Granada.
Despair was in every soul. The air was
filled with wailing and lamentation. "Woe,
woe is me, Alhama!" "Ay de mi, Alhama!"
Indignant with their old king, who had
brought destruction upon them, when Boabdil
came with his army of followers, they
flocked about him&mdash;"El Rey Chico!" (the
boy king) as they called him. Abdul Hassan
was forced to fly, and Boabdil reigned over
the expiring kingdom. It was a brief and
troubled reign.</p>

<p>In the famous "Court of the Lions" in the
Alhambra, visitors are shown to-day the
blood-stains left by the celebrated massacre
of the "Abencerrages." The Abencerrages
had supported the claim of Ayesha's rival,
Zoraya; and it is said that Boabdil invited the
Princes of this clan, some thirty in number,
to a friendly conference in the Alhambra, and
there had them treacherously beheaded at the
fountain.</p>

<p>But whether this blood-stain upon his
memory is as doubtful as those upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>[pg 107]</span>
stones at the fountain, seems an open
question.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:80%;"><a href="images/108.jpg"><img width="100%" src="images/108.jpg" alt="" /></a><p>From the painting by V. Brozik.</p>
<h4>Columbus at the Court of Ferdinand and Isabella.</h4></div>

<p>So stubborn was the defense, it appeared
sometimes as if the reduction of Granada
would have to be abandoned. Isabella's
courage and faith were sorely tried. But the
brave Queen infused her own courage
into the flagging spirits of her husband,
and kept alive the enthusiasm of the
people; and at last,&mdash;on the 2d of January,
1402,&mdash;the proud city capitulated. Boabdil
surrendered the keys of the Alhambra to
Ferdinand&mdash;the silver cross which had preceded
the King throughout the war gleamed
from a high tower; and from the loftiest pinnacle
of the Alhambra waved the banners of
Castile and Aragon.</p>

<p>The conflict which had lasted for 781 years
was over. The death of Roderick and the fall
of the Goths was avenged, and Christendom,
still weeping for the loss of Constantinople,
was consoled and took heart again.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>[pg 108]</span>




<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>


<p>The reduction of Granada had required
eleven years, and had drained the kingdom of
all its resources. It is not strange that Isabella
should have had no time to listen seriously
to a threadbare enthusiast asking for
money and ships for a strange adventure! To
have grown old and haggard in pressing an
unsuccessful project is not a passport to the
confidence of Princes. But the gracious
Queen had promised to listen to him when the
war with the Moors was concluded. So
now Columbus sought her out at Granada;
and it is a strange scene which the imagination
pictures&mdash;a shabby old man pleading with a
Queen in the halls of the Alhambra for permission
to lift the veil from an unsuspected Hemisphere;
artfully dwelling upon the glory of
planting the Cross in the dominions of the
Great Khan! The cool, unimaginative Ferdinand
listened contemptuously; but Isabella,
for once opposing the will of her "dear lord,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>[pg 109]</span>
arose and said, "The enterprise is mine. I
undertake it for Castile." And on the 3d of
August, 1492, the little fleet of caravels sailed
from the mouth of the same river whence had
once sailed the "ships of Tarshish," laden
with treasure for King Solomon and "Hiram,
King of Tyre." A union with Portugal&mdash;the
land of the Lusitanians and of Sertorius&mdash;was
all that was now required to make of the Spanish
Peninsula one kingdom. This Isabella
planned to accomplish by the marriage of her
oldest daughter, Isabella, with the King of
Portugal. Her son John, heir to the Spanish
throne, had died suddenly just after his marriage
with the daughter of Maximilian, Emperor
of Germany.</p>

<p>This terrible blow was swiftly followed by
another, the death of her daughter Isabella,
and also that of the infant which was expected
to unite the kingdoms of Portugal and Spain.
The succession of Castile and Aragon now
passed to Joanna, her second daughter, who
had married Philip, Archduke of Austria and
son of Maximilian, an unfortunate child who
seemed on the verge of madness.</p>

<p>Isabella's youngest daughter, Catherine, became
the wife of Henry VIII. of England.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>[pg 110]</span>
Happily the mother did not live to witness this
child's unhappiness; but her heart-breaking
losses and domestic griefs were greater than
she could bear. The unbalanced condition of
Joanna, upon whom rested all her hopes, was
undermining her health. The results of the
expedition of Columbus had exceeded the
wildest dreams of romance. Gold was pouring
in from the West enough to pay for the
war with the Moors many times over, and for
all wars to come. Spain, from being the
poorest, had suddenly become the richest
country in Europe; richest in wealth, in territory,
and in the imperishable glory of its discovery.
But Isabella,&mdash;who had been the instrument
in this transformation,&mdash;who had
built up a firm united kingdom and swept it
clean of heretics, Jews, and Moors,&mdash;was still
a sad and disappointed woman, thwarted in
her dearest hopes; and on the 26th of November,
1504, she died leaving the fruits of her
triumphs to a grandson six years old.</p>

<p>This infant Charles was proclaimed King of
Castile under the regency of his ambitious
father, the Archduke of Austria, and his insane
mother. The death of the Archduke
and the incapacity of Joanna in a few years
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[pg 111]</span>
gave to Ferdinand the control of the two kingdoms
for which he had contended and
schemed, until his own death in 1516, when
the crowns of Castile and Aragon passed to
his grandson, who was proclaimed Charles I.,
King of Spain.</p>

<p>A plain, sedate youth of sixteen was called
from his home in Flanders to assume the
crowns of Castile and Aragon. Silent, reserved,
and speaking the Spanish language
very imperfectly, the impression produced by
the young King was very unpromising. No
one suspected the designs which were maturing
under that mask; nor that this boy was
planning to grasp all the threads of diplomacy
in Europe, and to be the master of kings.</p>

<p>In 1517 Maximilian died, leaving a vacant
throne in Germany to be contended for by the
ambitious Francis I. of France and Maximilian's
grandson, Charles.</p>

<p>It was a question of supremacy in Europe.
So the successful aspirant must win to himself
Leo X., Henry VIII. and his great minister
Wolsey, and after that the Electors of Germany.
It required consummate skill. Francis
I. was an able player. The astute Wolsey
made the moves for his master Henry VIII.,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>[pg 112]</span>
keeping a watchful eye on Charles, "that
young man who looks so modest, and soars so
high"; while Leo X., unconscious of the coming
Reformation, was craftily aiding this side
or that as benefit to the Church seemed to be
promised.</p>

<p>But that "modest young man" played the
strongest game. Charles was, by the unanimous
vote of the Electors, raised to the imperial
throne; and the grandson of Isabella,
as Charles I. of Spain and Charles V. of Germany,
possessed more power than had been
exercised by any one man since the reign of
Augustus. The territory over which he had
dominion in the New World was practically
without limit. Mexico surrendered to Cortez
(1521) and Peru to Pizarro (1532); Ponce de
Leon was in Florida and de Soto on the banks
of the Mississippi; while wealth, fabulous in
amount, was pouring into Spain, and from
thence into Flanders.</p>

<p>The history of Charles belongs, in fact,
more to Europe than to Spain. No slightest
tenderness seems to have existed in his cold
heart for the land of Isabella, which he seemed
to regard simply as a treasury from which to
draw money for the objects to which he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>[pg 113]</span>
really devoted. So, in fact, Spain was governed
by an absolute despot who was Emperor
of Germany, where he resided, and she
visibly declined from the strength and prosperity
which had been created by the wise and
personal administration of Ferdinand and
Isabella.</p>

<p>The Cortes, where the deputies had never
been allowed the privilege of debate, had
been at its best a very imperfect expression of
popular sentiment; and now was reduced to a
mere empty form. Abuses which had been
corrected under the vigilant personal administration
of two able and patriotic sovereigns
returned in aggravated form. Misrule
and disorder prevailed, while their King
was absorbed in the larger field of European
politics and diplomacy.</p>

<p>The light in which Spain shines in this,
which is always accounted her most glorious
period, was that of Discovery and Conquest
and the enormous wealth coming therefrom;
all of which was bestowed by that shabby adventurer
and suppliant at the Alhambra, in
whom Isabella alone believed, and who, after
enriching Spain beyond its wildest expectations,
was permitted to die in poverty and neglect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[pg 114]</span>
at Valladolid in 1506! History has written
its verdict: imperishable renown to Columbus,
Balboa, Magellan, and the navigators
who dared such perils and won so much; and
eternal infamy to the men who planted a
bloodstained Cross in those distant lands.
The history of the West Indies, of Mexico,
and Peru is unmatched for cruelty in the annals
of the world; and Isabella's is the only
voice that was ever raised in defense of the
gentle, helpless race which was found in those
lands.</p>

<p>The Reformation, which had commenced in
Germany with the reign of Charles V., had
assumed enormous proportions. Charles,
who was a bigot with "heart as hard as hammered
iron," was using with unsparing hand
the Inquisition, that engine of cruelty created
by his grandmother. And while his captains,
the "conquistadors," were burning and torturing
in the West, he was burning and torturing
in the East. His entire reign was occupied
in a struggle with his ambitious rival
Francis I., and another and vain struggle with
the followers of Luther.</p>

<p>He had married Isabel, the daughter of the
King of Portugal. Philip, his son and heir,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[pg 115]</span>
was born in 1527. The desire of his heart
was to secure for this son the succession to
the imperial throne of Germany. To this the
electors would not consent. He was defeated
in the two objects dearest to his heart: the
power to bequeath this imperial possession to
Philip, and the destruction of Protestantism.
So this most powerful sovereign since the day
of Charlemagne felt himself ill-used by Fate.
Weary and sick at heart, in the year 1556 he
abdicated in favor of Philip. The Netherlands
was his own to bestow upon his son, as
that was an inheritance from his father, the
Archduke of Austria. So the fate of Philip
does not seem to us so very heart-breaking,
as, upon the abdication of his father, he was
King of Spain, of Naples, and of Sicily; Duke
of Milan; Lord of the Netherlands and of the
Indies, and of a vast portion of the American
continent stretching from the Atlantic to the
Pacific!</p>

<p>Such was the inheritance left to his son by
the disappointed man who carried his sorrows
to the monastery at St. Yuste, where the
austerities and severities he practiced finally
cost him his life (1558). But let no one suppose
that these penances were on account of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>[pg 116]</span>
cruelties practiced upon his Protestant subjects!
From his cloister he wrote to the
inquisitors adjuring them to show no mercy;
to deliver all to the flames, even if they should
recant; and the only regret of the dying penitent
was that he had not executed Luther!</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>[pg 117]</span>




<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>


<p>Philip established his capital at Madrid,
and commenced the Palace of the Escurial,
nineteen miles distant, which stands to-day as
his monument. His coronation was celebrated
by an <i>auto-da-f&#233;</i> at Valladolid, which it is said
"he attended with much devotion." One of
the victims, an officer of distinction, while
awaiting his turn said to him: "Sire, how can
you witness such tortures?" "Were my own
son in your place I should witness it," was the
reply; which was a key to the character of the
man.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:80%;"><a href="images/118.jpg"><img width="100%" src="images/118.jpg" alt="" /></a><p>From the painting by Velasquez.</p>
<h4>The Surrender of Breda.</h4></div>

<p>He asserted his claim through his mother,
the Princess Isabel of Portugal, to the throne
of that country, and after a stubborn contest
with the Lusitanians, the long-desired union
of Spain and Portugal was accomplished.
This event was celebrated by Cervantes in a
poem which extravagantly lauds his sovereign.
Henry VIII. had been succeeded in
England by Mary, daughter of his unhappy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>[pg 118]</span>
Queen, Catherine of Aragon, who, it will be
remembered, was the daughter of Ferdinand
and Isabella. Mary had inherited the intense
religious fervor and perhaps the cruel instincts
of her mother's family, and she quickly
set about restoring Protestant England to the
Catholic faith. Philip saw in a union with
Mary and a joint sovereignty over England,
such as he hoped would follow, an immense
opportunity for Spain. The marriage took
place with great splendor, and in the desire to
please her handsome husband, of whom she
was very fond, she commenced the work
which has given her the title, "Bloody Mary."
In vain were human torches lighted to lure
Philip from Spain, where he lingered. She
did not win his love, nor did Philip reign
conjointly with his royal consort in England.
Mary died in 1558, and her Protestant sister
Elizabeth, daughter of Anne Boleyn, was
Queen of England.</p>

<p>Philip had made up his mind that Protestantism
should be exterminated in his kingdom
of the Netherlands. He could not go
there himself, so he looked about for a suitable
instrument for his purpose. The Duke of
Alva was the man chosen. He was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>[pg 119]</span>
appointed Viceroy, with full authority to carry
out the pious design. Heresy must cease to
exist in the Netherlands. The arrival of Alva,
clothed with such despotic powers, and the
atrocities committed by him, caused the
greatest indignation in the Netherlands. The
Prince of Orange, aided by the Counts
Egmont and Horn, organized a party to resist
him, and a revolution was commenced
which lasted for forty years, affording one of
the blackest chapters in the history of Europe.
The name of Alva stands at the head of the
list of men who have wrought desolation and
suffering in the name of religion. The other
European states protested, and Elizabeth, in
hot indignation, gave aid to the persecuted
states.</p>

<p>Philip had contracted a marriage, after
Mary's death, with the daughter of that terrible
woman Catherine de Medici, widow of
Henry II. of France, and there is much reason
to believe that it was this Duke of Alva
who planned the Massacre of St. Bartholomew.
There were sinister conferences between
Catherine, Philip, and Alva, and little
doubt exists that the hideous tragedy which
occurred in Paris on the night of August 24,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>[pg 120]</span>
1572, was arranged in Madrid, and had its first
inception in the cruel breast of Alva.</p>

<p>There had not been much love existing before
between Philip and Elizabeth, who it is
said had refused the hand of her Spanish
brother-in-law. But after her interference in
the Netherlands, and when her ships were intercepting
and waylaying Spanish ships
returning with treasure from the West, and
when at last the one was the accepted champion
of the Protestant, and the other of the
Catholic cause, they became avowed enemies.
Philip resolved to prepare a mighty armament
for the invasion of England.</p>

<p>In 1587 Elizabeth sent Sir Francis Drake
to reconnoiter and find out what Philip was
doing. He appeared with twenty-five vessels
before Cadiz. Having learned all he
wanted, and burned a fleet of merchant vessels,
he returned to his Queen.</p>

<p>In May, 1588, a fleet of one hundred and
thirty ships, some "the largest that ever
plowed the deep," sailed from Lisbon for the
English coast. We may form some idea to-day
of what must have been the feeling in
England when this Armada, unparalleled in
size, appeared in the English Channel! If
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>[pg 121]</span>
Sir Francis Drake's ships were fewer and
smaller, he could match the Spaniards in audacity.
He sent eight fireships right in
among the close-lying vessels. Then, in the
confusion which followed, while they were
obstructed and entangled with their own
fleet, he swiftly attacked them with such vigor
that ten ships were sunk or disabled, and the
entire fleet was demoralized. Then a storm
overtook the fleeing vessels, and the winds and
the waves completed the victory. As in the
Spanish report of the disaster thirty-five is the
number of ships acknowledged to be lost, we
may imagine how great was the destruction.
So ended Philip's invasion of England, and
the great Spanish "Armada."</p>

<p>Philip II. died, 1598, in the Palace of the
Escurial which he had built, and with that
event ends the story of Spain's greatness.
The period of one hundred and twenty-five
years, including the reigns of Ferdinand and
Isabella, of Charles V., and of Philip II., is, in
a way, one of unmatched splendor. Spain
had not like England by slow degrees expanded
into great proportions, but through
strange and perfectly fortuitous circumstances,
she had, from a proud obscurity,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>[pg 122]</span>
suddenly leaped into a position of commanding
power and magnificence. Fortune threw into
her lap the greatest prize she ever had to bestow,
and at the same time gave her two
sovereigns of exceptional qualities and abilities.
The story of this double reign is the
romance, the fairy tale of history. Then
came the magnificent reign of Charles V. with
more gifts from fortune&mdash;the imperial crown,
if not a substantial benefit to Spain, still bringing
dignity and &#233;clat. But under this glittering
surface there had commenced even then
a decline. Under Philip II. she was still magnificent,
Europe was bowing down to her, but
the decline was growing more manifest; and
with the accession of his puny son, Philip III.,
there was little left but a brilliant past, which
a proud and retrospective nation was going to
feed upon for over three centuries. But it
takes some time for such dazzling effulgence
to disappear. The glamour of the Spanish
name was going to last a long time and picturesquely
veil her decay. The memory of
such an ascendancy in Europe nourished the
intense national pride of her people. The
name Castilian took on a new significance.</p>

<p>Nor can we wonder at their pride in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>[pg 123]</span>
name "Castilian." Its glory was not the
capricious gift of fortune, but won by a devotion,
a constancy, and a fidelity of purpose
which are unique in the history of the world.
For seven hundred years the race for which
that name stands had kept alive the national
spirit, while their land was occupied by an
alien civilization. These were centuries of
privation and suffering and hardship; but
never wavering in their purpose, and by
brave deeds which have filled volumes, they
reclaimed their land and drove out the
Moors.</p>

<p>This is what gives to the name "Castilian,"
its proud significance. But when degenerate
Hidalgos and Grandees, debauched by wealth
and luxury, gloried in the name; when by
rapacity and cruelty they destroyed the lands
their valor had won; and when the Inquisition
became their pastime and the rack and the
wheel their toys&mdash;then the name Castilian began
to take on a sinister meaning. Spain's
most glorious period was not when she was
converting the Indies and Mexico and Peru
into a hell, not when Charles V. was playing
his great game of diplomacy in Europe, but
in that pre-Columbian era when a brave and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>[pg 124]</span>
rugged people were keeping alive their national
life in the mountains of the Asturias.
Well may Spain do honor to that time by calling
the heir to her throne the "Prince of the
Asturias!"</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>[pg 125]</span>




<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>


<p>The history of the century after the
death of Philip II. is one of rapid decline;
with no longer a powerful master-mind
to hold the state together. Every
year saw the court at Madrid more splendid,
and the people,&mdash;that insignificant
factor,&mdash;more wretched, and sinking deeper
and deeper into poverty. In fact, in spite
of the fabulous wealth which fortune had
poured upon her, Spain was becoming poor.
But nowhere in Europe was royalty invested
with such dignity and splendor of ceremonial,
and the ambitious Marie de Medici, widow of
Henry IV., was glad to form alliances for her
children with those of Philip III. The
"Prince of the Asturias," who was soon to
become Philip IV., married her daughter, Isabella
de Bourbon, and the Infanta, his sister,
was at the same time married to the young
Louis XIII., King of France.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:70%;"><a href="images/126.jpg"><img width="100%" src="images/126.jpg" alt="Philip IV. of Spain." /></a><p>From the portrait by Velasquez.</p>
<h4>Philip IV. of Spain.</h4></div>


<p>The remnant of the Moors who still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>[pg 126]</span>
lingered in the land were called <i>Moriscos</i>;
and under a very thin surface of submission
to Christian Spain, they nursed
bitter memories and even hopes that some
miracle would some day restore them to what
was really the land of their fathers. A very
severe edict, promulgated by Philip II., compelling
conformity in all respects with Christian
living, and&mdash;as if that were not a part of
Christian living&mdash;forbidding <i>ablutions</i>, led to
a serious revolt. And this again led to the
forcible expulsion of every Morisco in Spain.</p>

<p>In 1609, by order of Philip III., the last of
the Moors were conveyed in galleys to the
African coast whence they had come just nine
hundred years before.</p>

<p>In a narrative so drenched with tears, it is
pleasant to hear of light-hearted laughter.
We are told that when the young King Philip
III. saw from his window a man striking his
forehead and laughing immoderately he said:
"That man is either mad, or he is reading
'Don Quixote'"&mdash;which latter was the case.
But the story written by Cervantes did more
than entertain. Chivalry had lingered in the
congenial soil of Spain long after it had disappeared
in every other part of Europe; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>[pg 127]</span>
when in the person of Don Quixote it was
made to appear so utterly ridiculous, it was
heard of no more.</p>

<p>Philip III., who died in 1621, was succeeded
by his son Philip IV. As in the reign of his
father worthless favorites ruled, while a profligate
king squandered the money of the people
in lavish entertainments and luxuries. Much
has been written about the visit of Charles,
Prince of Wales (afterward Charles I.), accompanied
by the Duke of Buckingham, at his
court; whither the young Prince had come
disguised, to see the Infanta, Philip's sister,
whom he thought of making his queen.
Probably she did not please him, or perhaps
the alliance with Protestant England was not
acceptable to the pious Catholic family of
Philip. At all events, Henrietta, sister of
Louis XIII. of France, was his final choice;
and shared his terrible misfortunes a few years
later.</p>

<p>A revolt of the Catalonians on the French
frontier led to a difficulty with France, which
was finally adjusted by the celebrated "treaty
of the Pyrenees." In this treaty was included
the marriage of the young King Louis XIV.
and Maria Theresa, daughter of Philip IV.,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>[pg 128]</span>
the King of Spain. The European Powers
would only consent to this union upon condition
that Louis should solemnly renounce
all claim to the Spanish crown for himself and
his heirs; which promise had later a somewhat
eventful history.</p>

<p>Seven of the United Provinces had achieved
their independence during the reign of the
third Philip, who had also driven out of his
kingdom six hundred thousand Moriscos; by
far the most skilled and industrious portion of
the community. And now, at the close of the
reign of Philip IV., the kingdom was further
diminished by the loss of Portugal; which, in
1664, the Lusitanians recovered, and proclaimed
the Duke of Braganza King. When
we add to this the loss of much of the Netherlands,
and of the island of Jamaica, and concessions
here and there to France and to Italy,
it will be obvious that a process of contraction
had soon followed that of Spain's phenomenal
expansion!</p>

<p>During the reign of Carlos II., who succeeded
his father (1665), Spain was still further
diminished by the cession to Louis XIV.,
in 1678, of more provinces in the Low Countries
and also of the region now known
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>[pg 129]</span>
as Alsace and Lorraine; which, it will be remembered,
have in our own time passed from
the keeping of France to that of victorious
Germany.</p>

<p>In the year 1655 the island of Jamaica was
captured by an expedition sent out by Cromwell.
It was between the years 1670 and 1686
that the Spaniard and the Anglo-Saxon had
their first collision in America. St. Augustine
had been founded in 1565, and the old Spanish
colony was much disturbed in 1663, when
Charles II. of England planted an English
colony in their near neighborhood (the Carolinas).
During the war between Spain and
England at the time above mentioned, feeling
ran high between Florida and the Carolinas,
and houses were burned and blood was shed.
Spain had felt no concern about the little English
colony planted on the bleak New England
coast in 1620. Death by exposure and starvation
promised speedily to remove that. But
the settlement on the Carolinas was more serious,
and at the same time the French were
planting a colony of their own at the mouth
of the Mississippi. The "lords of America"
began to feel anxious about their control of
the Gulf of Mexico. The cloud was a very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>[pg 130]</span>
small one, but it was not to be the last which
would dim their skies in the West.</p>

<p>The one thing which gives historic importance
to the reign of Carlos II. is that it marks
the close&mdash;the ignominious close&mdash;of the great
Hapsburg dynasty in Spain. And if the death
of Carlos, in 1700, was a melancholy event, it
is because with it the scepter so magnificently
wielded by Ferdinand and Isabella passed to
the keeping of the House of Bourbon, whose
Spanish descendants have, excepting for two
brief intervals, ruled Spain ever since.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>[pg 131]</span>




<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>


<p>The last century had wrought great changes
in European conditions. "The Holy Roman
Empire," after a thirty-years' war with
Protestantism, was shattered, and the Emperor
of Germany was no longer the head of
Europe. Protestant England had sternly
executed Charles I., and then in the person of
James II. had swept the last of the Catholic
House of Stuart out of her kingdom. France,
on the foundation laid by Richelieu, had developed
into a powerful despotism, which her
King, Louis XIV., was making magnificent
at home and feared abroad.</p>

<p>For Spain it had been a century of steady
decline, with loss of territory, power, and prestige.
No longer great in herself, she was
regarded by her ambitious neighbor, Louis
XIV., as only a make-weight in the supremacy
in Europe upon which he was determined.
He had been ravaging the enfeebled German
Empire, and now a friendly fate opened a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>[pg 132]</span>
peaceful door through which he might make
Spain contribute to his greatness.</p>

<p>Carlos II. died (1700) without an heir.
There was a vacant throne in Spain to which&mdash;on
account of Louis' marriage, years before,
with the Spanish Princess Maria Theresa&mdash;his
grandson Philip had now the most
valid claim. The other claimant, Archduke
Karl, son of Leopold, Emperor of Germany,
in addition to having a less direct hereditary
descent, was unacceptable to the Spanish people,
who had no desire to be ruled again
by an occupant of the Imperial throne of
Germany.</p>

<p>So, as Louis wished it, and the Spanish people
also wished it, there was only one obstacle
to his design; that was a promise made at the
time of his marriage that he would never claim
that throne for himself or his heirs. But
when the Pope, after "prayerful deliberation,"
absolved him from that promise the way was
clear. This grandson, just seventeen years
old, was proclaimed Philip V., King of Spain,
and Louis in the fullness of his heart exclaimed,
"The Pyrenees have ceased to
exist!"</p>

<p>Perhaps it would have been better for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>[pg 133]</span>
King if he had not made that dramatic
exclamation. A man who could remove
mountains to make a path for his ambitions
might also drain seas! England took warning.
She had been quietly bearing his insults
for a long time, and not till he had impertinently
threatened to place upon her throne
the Pretender, the exiled son of James II.,
had she joined the coalition against the
French King. But now she sent more
armies, and a great captain to re-enforce
Prince Eugene, who was fighting this battle
for the Archduke Karl and for Europe.</p>

<p>But Louis had reached the summit. He
was to go no higher than he had climbed when
he uttered that vain boast. Philip V. was
acknowledged King in 1702, and in 1704
<i>Blenheim</i> had been fought and won by Marlborough,
and the decline of the <i>Grand
Monarque</i> had commenced.</p>

<p>The war against him by a combined Europe
now became the war of the "Spanish Succession."
England and Holland united with
Emperor Leopold to curb his limitless ambition.
The purpose of the war of the "Spanish
Succession" was, ostensibly, to place the
Austrian Archduke upon the throne of Spain;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>[pg 134]</span>
its real purpose was to check the alarming
ascendancy of Louis XIV. in Europe.</p>

<p>It lasted for years, the poor young King
and Queen being driven from one city to another,
while the Austrian Archduke was at
Madrid striving to reign over a people who
would not recognize him.</p>

<p>Spain was being made the sport of three
nations in pursuance of their own ambitious
ends. Her land was being ravaged by foreign
armies, recruited from three of her own disaffected
provinces; while a young King with
whom she was well satisfied was peremptorily
ordered to make way for one Austria, England,
and Holland preferred. It was a
humiliating proof of the decline in national
spirit, and the old Castilian pride must have
sorely degenerated for such things to be possible.</p>

<p>Finally, after Louis XIV. had once more
given solemn oath that the crowns of France
and Spain should never be united, the "Peace
of Utrecht" was signed (1713). But the provisions
of the treaty were momentous for
Spain. She was at one stroke of the pen
stripped of half her possessions in Europe.
Philip V. was acknowledged King of Spain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>[pg 135]</span>
and the Indies. But Sicily, with its regal
title, was ceded to the Duke of Savoy; Milan,
Naples, Sardinia, and the Netherlands went
to Karl, now Emperor Charles VI. of Germany;
while Minorca and Gibraltar passed to
the keeping of England.</p>

<p>No one felt unmixed satisfaction, except
perhaps England. The Archduke had failed
to get his throne, and to wear the double
crown like Charles V. Louis had carried his
point. He had succeeded in keeping the
kingdom for his grandson. But that kingdom
was dismembered, and had shrunk to insignificant
proportions in Europe, while England,
most fortunate of all, had carried off the
key to the Mediterranean. That little rocky
promontory of Gibraltar was potentially of
more value than all the rest!</p>

<p>Such was the beginning of the dynasty of
the Bourbon in Spain. Philip was succeeded,
upon his death in 1746, by his son Ferdinand
VI., who also died, in 1759, and was succeeded
by his brother, Philip's second son, who was
known as Carlos III. When we try to praise
these princes of the wretched Bourbon line, it
is by mention of the evil they have refrained
from doing rather than the good they have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>[pg 136]</span>
done. So Carlos III. is said to have done
less harm to Spain than his predecessors. He
established libraries and academies of science
and of arts, and ruled like a kind-hearted gentleman,
without the vices of his recent predecessors.
His severity toward the Jesuits and
their forcible expulsion from Spain, in 1767,
are said to have been caused by personal resentment
on account of some slanderous
rumors regarding his birth, which were traced
to them.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>[pg 137]</span>




<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>


<p>But the fate of Spain was not now in the
hands of her Kings. Were they good or evil
she was destined henceforth to drift in the
currents of <i>circumstance</i>, that sternest of
masters, to whom her Kings as well as her
people would be obliged helplessly to bow.
All that she now possessed outside the borders
of her own kingdom was the West Indies,
her colonies in America, North and
South, and the Philippines, that archipelago
of a thousand isles in the southern Pacific,
where Magellan was slain by the savage inhabitants
after he had discovered it (1520).</p>

<p>Mexico and Peru had proved to be inexhaustible
sources of wealth, and when the gold
and silver diminished, the Viceroys in these and
the other colonies could compel the people to
wring rich products out of the soil, enough to
supply Spain's necessities. The inhabitants
of these colonies, composed of the aboriginal
races with an admixture of Spanish, had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>[pg 138]</span>
been treated as slaves and drudges for so many
centuries that they never dreamed of resistance,
nor questioned the justice of a fate which
condemned them always to toil for Spain.</p>

<p>In the North the feeble colony planted in
1620 had expanded into thirteen vigorous
English colonies. France, too, had been
colonizing in America, and had drawn her
frontier line from the mouth of the Mississippi
to Canada. In 1755 a collision occurred between
England and France over their American
boundaries. By the year 1759, France
had lost Quebec and every one of her strongholds,
and she formed an alliance with Spain
in a last effort to save her vanishing possessions
in America.</p>

<p>Spain's punishment for this interference
was swift. England promptly dispatched
ships to Havana and to the Philippines; and
when we read of the Anglo-Saxon capturing
Havana and the adjacent islands on one side
of the globe, and the City of Manila and fourteen
of the Philippines on the other, in the
midsummer of 1762, it has a slightly familiar
sound. And when the old record further
says, the "conquest in the West Indies cost
many precious lives, more of whom were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>[pg 139]</span>
destroyed by the climate than by the enemy,"
and still again, "the capture of Manila was
conducted with marvelous celerity and judgment,"
we begin to wonder whether we are
reading the dispatches of the Associated
Press in 1898, or history!</p>

<p>In the treaty which followed these victories,
upon condition of England's returning Havana,
and all the conquered territory excepting
a portion of the West India Islands, Spain
ceded to her the peninsula of Florida; while
France, who was obliged to give to England
all her territory east of the Mississippi, gave
to Spain in return for her services the city of
New Orleans, and all her territory west of the
great river. This territory was retroceded
to France by Spain in the year 1800, by the
"Treaty of Madrid," and in 1803 was purchased
by America from Napoleon, under the
title of "Louisiana."</p>

<p>There was a growing irritation in the Spanish
heart against England. She was crowding
Spain out of North America, had insinuated
herself into the West India Islands, and she
was mistress of Gibraltar. So it was with no
little satisfaction that they saw her involved in
a serious quarrel with her American colonies,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>[pg 140]</span>
at a time when a stubborn and incompetent
Hanoverian King was doing his best to destroy
her. The hour seemed auspicious for
recovering Gibraltar, and also to drive England
out of the West Indies. The alliance
with France had become a permanent one,
and was known as a <i>family compact</i> between
the Bourbon cousins Louis XV. and Carlos
III. France had at this time rather distracting
conditions at home; but she was thirsting
for revenge at the loss of her rich American
possessions, and besides, a sentimental interest
in the brave people who had proclaimed
their independence from the mother country,
and were fighting to maintain it, began to
manifest itself. It was fanned, no doubt, by
a desire for England's humiliation; but it
assumed a form too chivalric and too generous
for Americans ever to discredit by unfriendly
analysis of motive. Spain cared little for the
cause of the colonies; but she was quite willing
to help them by worrying and diverting
the energies of England. So she invested
Gibraltar. A garrison of only a handful of
men astonished Europe by the bravery of its
defense. Gibraltar was not taken by the
Bourbon allies, neither were the English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>[pg 141]</span>
driven out of the West Indies. But it was a
satisfaction to Spain to see her humbled by
her victorious colonies!</p>

<p>So Carlos III. had indirectly assisted in the
establishment of a republic on the confines of
his Mexican Empire; apparently unconscious
of the contagion in the word <i>independence</i>.
But he quickly learned this to his sorrow.
The story of the revolted and freed colonies
sped on the wings of the wind. And in Peru
a brave descendant of the Incas arose as a Deliverer.
He led sixty thousand men into a
vain fight for liberty. Of course the effort
failed, but a spirit had been awakened which
might be smothered, but never extinguished.</p>

<p>Carlos III. died in 1788 and was succeeded
by his son Carlos IV.</p>

<p>During the miserable reign of this miserable
King, France caught the infection from
the free institutions in America. The Republic
she had helped to create was fatal to monarchy
in her own land. A revolution accompanied
by unparalleled horrors swept
away the whole tyrannous system of centuries
and left the country a trembling wreck&mdash;but
free. The dream of a republic was brief.
Napoleon gathered the imperfectly organized
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>[pg 142]</span>
government into his own hands, then by successive
and rapid steps arose to Imperial
power. France was an Empire, and adoringly
submitted to the man who swiftly made her
great and feared in Europe. She had another
Charlemagne, who was bringing to his feet
Kings and Princes, and annexing half of
Europe to his empire!</p>

<p>Spain, all unconscious of his designs, and
perhaps thinking this invincible man might
help her to get back Gibraltar and to drive
the English out of the West Indies, joined
him in 1804 in a war against Great Britain;
and the following year the combined fleets of
France and Spain were annihilated by Lord
Nelson off Cape Trafalgar. Family dissensions
in the Spanish royal household at this
time were opportune for Napoleon's designs.
Carlos and his son Ferdinand were engaged
in an unseemly quarrel. Carlos appealed to
Napoleon regarding the treasonable conduct
and threats of his son. Nothing could have
better suited the purposes of the Emperor.
The fox had been invited to be umpire!
French troops poured into Spain. Carlos,
under protest, resigned in favor of his son,
who was proclaimed Ferdinand VII. (1807).
The young King was then invited to meet the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>[pg 143]</span>
Emperor for consultation at Bayonne. He
found himself a prisoner in France, and to
Joseph Bonaparte, brother of the Emperor,
was transferred the Crown of Spain.</p>

<p>The nation seemed paralyzed by the swiftness
and the audacity of these overturnings.
But soon popular indignation found expression.
Juntas were formed. The one at Seville,
calling itself the Supreme Junta, proclaimed
an alliance with Great Britain; its
purpose being the expulsion of the French
from their kingdom.</p>

<p>Spain was in a state of chaos. Joseph was
not without Spanish adherents, and there was
no leader, no legitimate head to give constitutional
stamp to the acts of the protesting
people, who without the usual formalities
convoked the Cortes. But while they were
groping after reforms, and while Lord Wellington
was driving back the French, Napoleon
had met his reverse at Moscow, and a
"War of Liberation" had commenced in
Germany.</p>

<p>The grasp upon the Spanish throne relaxed.
The captive King had permission to
return, and the reign of Joseph was ended by
his ignominious flight from the kingdom,
with one gold-piece in his pocket (1814).</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>[pg 144]</span>




<h2>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>


<p>The decade between 1804 and 1814 had
been very barren in external benefits to Spain,
with her King held in "honorable captivity"
in France, and the obscure Joseph abjectly
striving to please not his subjects, but his august
brother Napoleon. But in this time of
chaos, when there was no Bourbon King, no
long-established despotism to stifle popular
sentiment, the unsuspected fact developed
that Spain had caught the infection of freedom.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:70%;"><a href="images/144.jpg"><img width="100%" src="images/144.jpg" alt="Heroic Combat in the Pulpit of the Church of St.
Augustine, Saragossa, 1809." /></a><p>From the painting by C. Alvarez Dumont.</p>
<h4>Heroic Combat in the Pulpit of the Church of St.
Augustine, Saragossa, 1809.</h4></div>


<p>When, as we have seen, the Cortes assumed
all the functions of a government, that body
(in 1812) drew up a new Constitution for
Spain. So completely did this remodel the
whole administration, that the most despotic
monarchy in Europe was transformed into
the one most severely limited.</p>

<p>Great was the surprise of Ferdinand VII.
when, in 1814, he came to the throne of his
ejected father Carlos IV., to find himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>[pg 145]</span>
called upon to reign under a Constitution
which made Spain almost as free as a republic.
He promulgated a decree declaring the Cortes
illegal and rescinding all its acts, the Constitution
of 1812 included. Then when he had
re-established the Inquisition, which had
been abolished by the Cortes, when he had
publicly burned the impertinent Constitution,
and quenched conspiracies here and there, he
settled himself for a comfortable reign after
the good old arbitrary fashion.</p>

<p>The Napoleonic empire having been effaced
by a combined Europe, Ferdinand's Bourbon
cousins were in the same way restoring the
excellent methods of their fathers in France.</p>

<p>But there was a spirit in the air which was
not favorable to the peace of Kings. On the
American coast there stood "Liberty Enlightening
the World!" A growing, prosperous
republic was a shining example of what might
be done by a brave resistance to oppression
and a determined spirit of independence.</p>

<p>The pestilential leaven of freedom had been
at work while monarchies slept in security.
Ferdinand discovered that not only was there
a seditious sentiment in his own kingdom, but
every one of his American colonies was in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>[pg 146]</span>
open rebellion, and some were even daring to
set up free governments in imitation of the
United States.</p>

<p>Not only was Ferdinand's sovereignty
threatened, but the very principle of monarchy
itself was endangered.</p>

<p>Russia, Austria, and Prussia formed themselves
into a league for the preservation of
what they were pleased to call "The Divine
Right of Kings." It was the attack upon this
sacred principle, which was the germ of all
this mischievous talk about freedom. They
called their league "The Holy Alliance," and
what they proposed to do was to <i>stamp out
free institutions in the germ</i>.</p>

<p>In pursuance of this purpose, in 1819 there
appeared at Cadiz a large fleet, assembled for
the subjugation of Spanish America.</p>

<p>But there was an Anglo-Saxon America,
which had a preponderating influence in that
land now; and there was also an Anglo-Saxon
race in Europe which had its own views
about the "Divine Right of Kings," and also
concerning the mission of the "Holy Alliance."</p>

<p>The right of three European Powers to restore
to Spain her revolted colonies in America
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>[pg 147]</span>
was denied by President Monroe; not upon
the ground of Spain's inhumanity, and the inherent
right of the colonies to an independence
which they might achieve. Such was
the nature of England's protest, through her
Minister Canning. But President Monroe's
contention rested on a much broader ground.
In a message delivered in 1823 he uttered
these words: "European Powers must not extend
their political systems to any portion of
the American continent." The meaning of
this was that <i>America has been won for freedom</i>;
and no European Power will be permitted
to establish a monarchy, nor to coerce
in any way, nor to suppress inclinations toward
freedom, in any part of the Western
Hemisphere. This is the "Monroe Doctrine";
a doctrine which, although so startling
in 1832, had in 1896 become so firmly imbedded
in the minds of the people, that
Congress decided it to be a vital principle of
American policy.</p>

<p>But there was another and more serious
obstacle in the way of the proposed plan for
subjugating the Spanish-American colonies.
The army assembled by the Holy Alliance at
Cadiz was an offense to the people who had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>[pg 148]</span>
seen their Constitution burned and their hopes
of a freer government destroyed. Officers
and troops refused to embark, and joined a
concourse of disaffected people at Cadiz. A
smothered popular sentiment burst forth into
a series of insurrections throughout Spain,
and the astonished Ferdinand was compelled,
in 1820, to acknowledge the Constitution of
1812. This was not upholding the principle
of the "Divine Right of Kings"! So, under
the direction of the Holy Alliance, a French
army of one hundred thousand men moved
into Spain, took possession of her capital, and
for two years administered her affairs under a
regency, and then reinstated Ferdinand, leaving
a French army of occupation.</p>

<p>In this contest two distinct political parties
had developed&mdash;the Liberal party and the
party of Absolutism. As Ferdinand VII. became
the choice of the Liberals, and his
brother Don Carlos of the party of Absolutism,
we must infer either that it was a Liberalism
of a very mild type, or that Ferdinand's
views had been modified since the "Holy
Alliance" took his kingdom into its own
keeping. But his brother Carlos was the
adored of the Absolutists, and a plot was made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>[pg 149]</span>
to compel Ferdinand to abdicate in his favor.
This was the first of the Carlist plots, which,
with little intermission, and always in the interest
of despotism and bigotry, have
menaced the safety and well-being of Spain
ever since. From the year 1825 to 1898 there
has been always a Don Carlos to trouble the
political waters in that land.</p>

<p>So the mission of the "Holy Alliance" had
failed. Instead of rehabilitating the sacred
principle of the "Divine Right of Kings,"
they saw a powerful liberal party established
in a kingdom which was the very stronghold
of despotism. And instead of stamping out
free institutions, six Spanish-American colonies
had been recognized as free and independent
states (1826). Spain had for three
centuries ruled the richest and the fairest land
on the earth. She had shown herself utterly
undeserving of the opportunity, and unfit for
the responsibilities imposed by a great colonial
empire. She had sown the wind and now she
reaped the whirlwind. She did not own a
foot of territory on the continent she had discovered!</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>[pg 150]</span>




<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>


<p>In 1833 King Ferdinand VII. died, leaving
one child, the Princess Isabella, who was
three years old. Here was the opportunity
for the adherents of Don Carlos.</p>

<p>The "Salic law" had been one of the
Gothic traditions of ancient Spain, and had
with few exceptions been in force until 1789;
when Carlos IV. issued a "Pragmatic Sanction,"
establishing the succession through the
female as well as the male line; and on April
6, 1830, King Ferdinand confirmed this decree;
so, when Isabella was born, October 10,
1830, she was heiress to the throne, <i>unless</i> her
ambitious uncle, Don Carlos, could set aside
the decree abrogating the old Salic law, and
reign as Carlos IV.</p>

<p>In the three years before his brother's death
he had laid his plans for the coming crisis.
Isabella was proclaimed Queen under the
regency of her depraved mother Christina.
The extreme of the Catholic party, and of the
reactionary or absolutist party, flocked about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>[pg 151]</span>
the Carlist standard; while the party of the infant
Queen was the rallying point for the liberal
and progressive sentiment in the kingdom;
and her cause had the support of the
new reform government of Louis Philippe in
France, and of lovers of freedom elsewhere.</p>

<p>The party of the Queen triumphed. But
the Carlists survived; and, like the Bourbons
in France, have ever since in times of political
peril been a serious element to be reckoned
with.</p>

<p>During the infancy of the Queen, Spain was
the prey of unceasing party dissensions; Don
Carlos again and again trying to overthrow
her government, and again and again being
driven a fugitive over the Pyrenees; while
the Queen Regent, who was secretly married
to her Chamberlain, the son of a tobacconist
in Madrid, was bringing disgrace and odium
upon the Liberal party which she was supposed
to lead.</p>

<p>In 1843 the Cortes declared that the Queen
had attained her majority. Her disgraced
mother was driven out of the country and Isabella II.
ascended her throne. Isabella had a
younger sister, Maria Louisa, and in 1846 the
double marriage of these two children was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>[pg 152]</span>
celebrated with great splendor at Madrid.
The Queen was married to her cousin Don
Francisco d'Assisi, and her sister to the Duke
de Montpensier, fifth son of Louis Philippe.</p>

<h4>The Duke de la Torre sworn in as Regent before the Cortes of 1869.</h4></div>

<p>If, upon the birth of Liberalism in Spain,
that kingdom could have been governed by a
wise and competent sovereign, the concluding
chapters of this narrative might have been
very different. No time could have been less
favorable for a radical change in policy than
the period during which Isabella II. was
Queen of Spain. Personally she was all that
a woman and a Queen should not be. With
apparently not an exalted desire or ambition
for her country, this depraved daughter of a
depraved mother pursued her downward
course until 1868, when the nation would bear
no more. A revolution broke out. Isabella,
with her three children, fled to France and
there was once more a vacant throne in Spain.</p>

<p>The hopes of the Carlists ran high. But
the Cortes came to an unexpected decision.
They would have no Spanish Bourbon, be he
Carlist or Liberal. The reigning dynasty in
Italy was at this moment the adored of the
Liberals in Europe. So they offered the
Crown to Amadeo, second son of Victor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>[pg 153]</span>
Emmanuel, King of Italy. Three years were
quite sufficient for this experiment. The
young Amadeo was as glad to take off his
crown and to leave his kingdom, as the people
were to have him do so. He abdicated in
1873.</p>

<p>The Liberal party had been regretting their
loss of opportunity in 1870. France had passed
through many political phases in the last few
years, and the present French Republic had
just come into existence. Again Spain caught
the contagion from her neighbor, and Spanish
Liberalism became <i>Spanish Republicanism</i>.</p>

<p>When Castelar, that patriotic and sagacious
statesman, friend of Garibaldi, of Mazzini,
and of Kossuth, led this movement, many
hopefully believed the political millennium
was at hand, when Spain was about to join the
brotherhood of Republics! But something
more than a great leader is needed to create a
Republic. The magic of Castelar's eloquence,
the purity of his character, and the force of
his convictions were powerless to hold in
stable union the conflicting elements with
which he had to deal. The Carlists were
scheming, and the Cortes was driven to an
immediate decision.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>[pg 154]</span>

<p>The fugitive Queen Isabella had with her in
exile a young son Alfonso, seventeen years of
age. Alfonso was invited to return upon the
sole condition that his mother should be excluded
from his kingdom. An insurrection
which was being fomented by Don Carlos II.
led to this action of the Cortes, which was perhaps
the wisest possible under the circumstances.
The young Prince of the legitimate
Bourbon line was proclaimed King Alfonso
XII. in 1874.</p>

<p>A romantic marriage with his cousin Mercedes,
daughter of the Duke de Montpensier,
to whom he was deeply attached, speedily
took place. Only five months later Mercedes
died and was laid in the gloomy Escurial. A
marriage was then arranged with Christina,
an Austrian Archduchess, who was brought to
Madrid, and there was another marriage celebrated
with much splendor. The infant
daughter, who was born a few years later, was
named Mercedes; a loving tribute to the
adored young Queen he had lost, which did
credit as much to Christina as to Alfonso.</p>

<p>The hard school of exile had, no doubt,
been an advantage to Alfonso; and at the outset
of his reign he won the confidence of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>[pg 155]</span>
Liberals by saying "he wished them to understand
he was the first Republican in
Europe; and when they were tired of him they
had only to tell him so, and he would leave as
quickly as Amadeo had done." There was
not time to test the sincerity of these assurances.
Alfonso XII. died in 1885, and joined
Mercedes and his long line of predecessors in
the Escurial. Five months later his son was
born, and the throne which had been filled by
the little Mercedes passed to the boy who was
proclaimed Alfonso XIII. of Spain, under the
Regency of his mother Queen Christina.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>[pg 156]</span>




<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>


<p>At the beginning of the nineteenth century
the foreign dominions of Spain, although reduced,
were still a vast and imperial possession.
The colonial territory over which Alfonso
XIII. was to have sovereignty at the
close of that century, consisted of the Philippines,
the richest of the East Indies; Cuba, the
richest of the West Indies; Porto Rico, and a
few outlying groups of islands of no great
value.</p>

<p>Nowhere had the Constitution of 1812
awakened more hope than in Cuba; and from
the setting aside of that instrument by
Ferdinand VI. dates the existence of an insurgent
party in that beautiful but most
unhappy island. Ages of spoliation and
cruelty and wrong had done their work. The
iron of oppression had entered into the soul
of the Cuban. There was a deep exasperation
which refused to be calmed. From
thenceforth annexation to the United States,
or else a "<i>Cuba Libre</i>," was the determined,
and even desperate aim.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>[pg 157]</span>

<p>After a ten-years' war, 1868-78, the people
yielded to what proved a delusive promise of
home-rule. How could Spain bestow upon
her colony what she did not possess herself?
When in 1881 she tried to pacify Cuba by permitting
that island to send six Senators to sit
in the Spanish Cortes, it was a phantom of a
phantom. There was no outlet for the national
will in Spain itself. Her Cortes was
<i>not</i> a national assembly, and its members were
<i>not</i> the choice of the people. How much less
must they be so then in Cuba, where they
were only men of straw selected by the home
government, for the purpose of defeating&mdash;not
expressing&mdash;the popular will? The emptiness
of this gift was soon discovered. Then
came a shorter conflict, which was only a prelude
to the last.</p>

<p>A handful of ragged revolutionists, ignorant
of the arts of war, commenced the final
struggle for liberty on February 24, 1895,
under the leadership of Jos&#233; Marti. At the
end of two years a poorly armed band of guerrilla
soldiers had waged a successful contest
against 235,000 well-equipped troops, supported
by a militia and a navy, and maintained
by supplies from Spain; had adopted a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>[pg 158]</span>
Constitution, and were asking for recognition as
a free Republic. The Spanish commander
Martinez Campos was superseded by General
Weyler (1895), and a new and severer method
was inaugurated in dealing with the stubborn
revolutionists, but with no better success than
before. In August, 1897, an insurrection
broke out anew in the Philippines, and Spain
was in despair.</p>

<p>America calmly resisted all appeals for annexation
or for intervention in Cuba. Sympathy
for Cuban patriots was strong in the
hearts of the people, but the American Government
steadfastly maintained an attitude of
strict neutrality and impartiality, and with unexampled
patience saw a commerce amounting
annually to one hundred millions of dollars
wiped out of existence, her citizens reduced to
want by the destruction of their property,&mdash;some
of them lying in Spanish dungeons
subjected to barbarities which were worthy of
the Turkish Janizaries; our fleets used as a
coastguard and a police, in the protection of
Spanish interests, and more intolerable than
all else, our hearts wrung by cries of anguish
at our very doors!</p>

<p>But when General Weyler inaugurated a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>[pg 159]</span>
system for the deliberate starvation of thirty
thousand "Reconcentrados," an innocent
peasantry driven from their homes and herded
in cities, there to perish, the limit of patience
was reached. It was this touch of human
pity&mdash;this last and intolerable strain upon our
sympathies&mdash;which turned the scale.</p>

<p>While a profound feeling of indignation was
prevailing on account of these revolting
crimes against humanity, the battleship <i>Maine</i>
was, by request of Consul General Lee at that
place, dispatched to the harbor of Havana to
guard American citizens and interests. The
sullen reception of the <i>Maine</i> was followed on
February 15, 1898, by a tragedy which
shocked the world. Whether the destruction
of that ship and the death of 266 brave
men was from internal or external causes was
a very critical question. It was submitted to
a court of inquiry which, after long deliberation,
rendered the decision that the cause was&mdash;<i>external</i>.</p>

<p>It looked dark for lovers of peace! President
McKinley exhausted all the resources of
diplomacy before he abandoned hope of a
peaceful adjustment which would at the same
time compel justice to the Cuban people.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>[pg 160]</span>
But on April 25, 1898, it was declared that
war existed between Spain and America.</p>

<p>Less than a week after this declaration, in
the early morning of May 1, a victory over the
Spanish fleet at Manila was achieved by Commodore
Dewey, which made him virtual master
of the Philippines; and just two months later,
July 1 and 2 were made memorable by two
engagements in the West Indies, resulting, the
one in the defeat of the Spanish land forces
at San Juan, and the other in the complete
annihilation of Admiral Cervera's fleet in the
Bay of Santiago de Cuba&mdash;misfortunes so
overwhelming that overtures for peace were
quickly received at Washington from Madrid;
and the Spanish-American War was over.</p>

<p>The colonial empire of Spain was at an
end. The kingdom over which Alfonso XIII.
was soon to reign had at a stroke lost the
Spanish Indies in the West, and the Philippines
in the far East. To America was confided
the destiny of these widely separated
possessions, Porto Rico being permanently
ceded to the United States; while, according
to the avowed purpose at the outset of the war,
Cuba and the islands in the Pacific, as soon as
fitted for self-government, were to be given into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>[pg 161]</span>
their own keeping; a promise which in the case
of Cuba has already been redeemed, all possible
haste being made to prepare the Philippines
for a similar responsibility and destiny.</p>

<p>The quickness with which cordial relations
have been re-established between Spain and
the United States is most gratifying; and too
much praise cannot be bestowed upon that
proud, high-spirited people, who have accepted
the results of the war in a spirit so admirable.
In the loss of her American colonies, Spain
has been paying a debt contracted in the days
of her dazzling splendor&mdash;the time of the great
Charles and of Philip II.,&mdash;a kind of indebtedness
which in the case of nations is
never forgiven, but must be paid to the uttermost
farthing. If history teaches anything, it
is that the nations which have been cruel and
unjust sooner or later must "drink the cup of
the Lord's fury," just as surely as did the
Assyrians of old. Another thing which is
quite as obvious is that the nations of the
earth to-day must accept the ideals of the
advancing tide of modern civilization, or perish!
A people whose national festival is a
bull-fight, has still something to learn. Much
of medi&#230;valism still lingers in the methods and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>[pg 162]</span>
ideals of Spain. In the time of her opulence
and splendor these methods and ideals were
hers. So she believes in them and clings to
them still. She has been the victim of a
vicious political system, to which an intensely
proud, patriotic, and brave people have believed
they must be loyal.</p>

<p>In no other land&mdash;as we have seen&mdash;is the
national spirit so strong. Certainly nowhere
else has it ever been subjected to such strain
and survived. And this intense loyalty, this
overwhelming pride of race, this magnificent
valor, have all been summoned to uphold a
poor, perishing, vicious political system.</p>

<p>But the <i>Zeitgeist</i> is contagious. And at
no time has its influence in this conservative
kingdom been so apparent as since the Spanish-American
War; soon after this was over,
Alfonso ascended the throne of his fathers.
The important question of his marriage after
long consideration was decided by himself,
when he selected an English Princess, niece
of Edward VII., for his future Queen. The
Princess Ena is the daughter of Princess Beatrice,&mdash;youngest
child of Queen Victoria,&mdash;and Prince
Henry of Battenberg, who was
killed some years ago during one of the Kaffir
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>[pg 163]</span>
wars in South Africa. A royal marriage
uniting Protestant England and Catholic
Spain would at one time have cost a throne
and perhaps a head; and the cordiality, and
even enthusiasm, with which this union has
been greeted in England shows what seas of
prejudice have been sailed through and what
continents of sectarian differences have been
left behind; proving that the <i>Zeitgeist</i> has been
busy in England as well as in Spain.</p>

<p>The royal marriage of these two children&mdash;(the
King having just passed his twentieth
birthday)&mdash;attended by the traditional formalities,
and a revival of almost medi&#230;val
splendor, took place at Madrid, June 1, 1906.
The many romantic features attending the
courtship of the boy King and his English
girl-bride invested the occasion with a picturesque
interest for the whole world. And
yet&mdash;impossible as it would have seemed&mdash;there
existed some one degenerate enough to
convert it into a ghastly tragedy. While returning
to the royal palace over flower-strewn
streets, after the conclusion of the marriage
ceremony, a bomb concealed in a bouquet was
thrown from an upper window, hitting the
royal coach at which it was directly aimed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>[pg 164]</span>
The young King and Queen escaped as if by
a miracle from the wreck; and the destruction
intended for them bore death and mutilation
to scores of innocent people in no wise connected
with the Government; and Madrid, at
the moment of her supreme rejoicing, was converted
into a blood-stained, mourning city.</p>

<p>Never did anarchistic methods seem so utterly
divorced from intelligence as in this last
attempt at regicide. If it had succeeded, an
infant-nephew would have been King of Spain,
with a long regency, perhaps, of some well-seasoned
Castilian of the old school!</p>

<p>There was an incident in connection with
this marriage which deeply touches the American
heart. The special envoy, bearing a letter
of congratulation to the King from President
Roosevelt, was received with a warmth and
consideration far exceeding what was required
by diplomatic usage, and the stars and stripes
helping to adorn Madrid for the great festival
gave assurance that Spain and the United
States are really friends again.</p>
